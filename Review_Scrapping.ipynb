The scenery and costumes were beautiful. Some parts were a bit slow moving, but all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n",

I do feel that the \"quirky\" humor is at times out of place, clunky in its execution. Trust me, I don't mind odd tones, I love Wes Anderson films, but this movie doesn't ever seem to find its footing. Overall, a good film.\n",

            "Like a Bergman movie, Noam directed a sensitive and at the same time a film that explodes emotions in your face. Scartlett and Adam are espetacular\n",
            "Best drama/relationship film since Eternall Sunshine of the spotless mind\n",
            "Breathtaking acting from Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson fortifies an honest, finely observed script in what is probably Noah Baumbach's best work to date.\n",
            "The movie is fantastic. The script by Noah Baumbach is so realistic and represents what a real marriage is, making the audience cry and laugh with what he writes. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are spectacular and they help the film to be really touching. They should have won the Oscar in their categories. Laura Dern is awesome as the lawyer Nora Fanshaw, her Oscar nomination is really deserving, but I think she was not the best supporting actress this year.  The editing and score are perfect and Noah Baumbach directs the movie with love. The best 2019 film!\n",
            "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jojo_rabbit_2019/reviews?type=user\n",
            "I've given this about a month post-Oscar. I found this to be some of the most refreshing satire I've seen in years. It is a pure joy to see it receive the accolades it has from audiences and the academy and to see so many faux critics taken to task for their original reviews of this fine piece of work. Suffice it to say that a few of the green tomatoes are wondering if they chose the right profession. It takes quite a pro to recognize satire when the satire is willing to go to these places. Jo Jo Rabbit is a memorable film that is funny, challenging, incredibly well kid acted--and anchored by a beautiful character and performance (Johansen). Almost flawless satire. It's funny, but what many critics call \"cute\" in Jo Jo--they raved about in Parasite (which I also loved). Are we supposed to take from this that when Mr. Bong does strange, funny and family--it's genius, but if the protagonist is a small German boy---\"Well, then it's not funny!?\" Jo Jo Rabbit speaks as strongly and intelligently against hate as Roma (which I ALSO loved).\n",
            "Fantastic movie in every aspect\n",
            "When the movie began I realized that the writer must have a strong message to take such a risk. I overall enjoyed this sour part of history coated in sugar.  Nevertheless, you need to come into it with an open mind, but it's a reminder that heroism and perseverance are qualities that are most admired during times of trial and tribulation.  Incredible acting... I am truly impressed.  It made we want go back and read the diary of Frank. It reminded me of the day my sister came home discussing what she read from the book. Great movie.\n",
            "So funny and touching.\n",
            "A truly unique film, part coming of age story, part comedy, part war movie, even part fantasy in a way, Jojo Rabbit is at its heart a film of and about compassion, about humanity. It will bring irresistible and prolonged laughter throughout but will also bring tears in the stark moments which remind the viewer that while this is WWII through the eyes of a naive child . . . It is still WWII. Its development of the imaginary friend \"Adolf Hitler\" as a projected father figure by a lonely boy who has given himself over to propaganda as a way to find meaning is deftly and beautifully handled, as subtle but unmistakable hints of evil slowly manifest themselves while Jojo discovers the true nature of the world he lives in. Cannot overrecommend this film.\n",
            "Stellar cast with an outrageously funny script that still maintains a heartfelt message to it, two young leads shine with amazing performances.\n",
            "Uneven tone but ultimately satisfying\n",
            "Loved it. Cried. Taika is in a zone all his own, and bless him for that. \"What we do in the Shadows\" was brilliant, as was \"Boy\" and \"Ragnarok\" - also his first short \"Two cars, one night\" - but I had no idea how he was going to make this work. In the end he made it look effortless. Left me sobbing, in a good way! Real, true, relatable, funny, heartbreaking cinema.\n",
            "This movie is terrible. Not sure why people are so interested in it. I’m sure it’s very offensive to a lot of people \n",

            "\n",
            "That could be my entire review, but of course there is more to it than that.  This movie is a condemnation of a society failing to take care of its people, especially those who need it most.  In the beginning of the film Arthur is a struggling young man with a poor paying job, barely holding things together as he is supporting his elderly mother.  He suffers from the effects of a brain injury received in his youth, but with his medication and help from meetings with his public social worker he is getting by.  When he loses his job, can no longer afford his prescriptions, and loses his case worker due to budget cuts in the city, his world begins to fall apart, as does his ability to interact appropriately with other humans.\n",
            "\n",
            "This film is fantastic on essentially all accounts and hearkens to the gritty, unsettling mood and empathy for a loathesome lead character akin to another fantastic film \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.\"  If you liked Joker please do yourself a favor and check out that film, but during daylight hours on a sunny day.  It is because of this bleak outlook and overall quality that it is almost hard to believe this is a DC universe film and not a standalone independent film.  However, there is enough connection to the familiar Batman story material to clearly link this to others in that universe, in story, if not tone.\n",
            "I went into it thinking I wouldn't like it, but Phoenix' performance was very good. The other characters are not very nuanced. \"Bad rich guys\".\n",
            "Joker is a movie we don't get to see as often anymore. It cannot be argued that it is an award winning film. The movie itself shows the world how it truly is and all the harsh reality that happens around us when all we do is walk away and ignore it until we're the ones in the situation. Joker has won many awards and very well deserved especially for its amazing actresses. I believe the director of this film wanted us to know the Joker/Authors story and he gave us more than that. We learned about this story, what drove him to be the way he is and what all the hero stuff really meant. Seeing that the way he was treated and how it's something that happens all over. Joker is quite a film. I believe it speaks for itself and it has many things to say. It brought out so many things out of the audience including me and I as well as many other people can back up how incredibly realistic that film was. Everything the author did was done on purpose and our job as an audience is to figure out that purpose. In my point of view it's something that creates emphasis. The Director of the film as well as any author has the decision whether to repeat something or add something new. How I see it, the director repeated himself to emphasize on that certain point. It lets the audience see just how important it is. It is something done with purpose! There are many reasons why a movie would keep repeating itself and I also believe that a movie can have more than one plot. This movie in particular is one of them. I would really recommend this film for the great actresses as well as the content it carries. The movie itself is exciting and intriguing.\n",
            "With the help of a well-written script and the magnificent performance of Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is one of the best films of 2019\n",
            "Great character study\n",
            "It was a good, interesting movie, but i don't see it as a joker origin movie.\n",

            "The cars were cool, but the movie is slowwwww\n",
            "Wow.  This was quite disappointing for Tarantino.  I'm just being frank.  This is definitely not his finest hour.  I'd been looking forward to this one for a while and now that I watched it, I gotta say, throughout most of the film I just felt a big sense of \"meh\".  Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth is no doubt my favorite character; I love his calm, collected badassery.  The performances were all good at least, but none great or award-worthy.  Even the dialogue was nothing to ride home about, which is a department Quentin normally excels in.  Nothing special happens throughout the movie.  It's shot well, has the signature Tarantino soundtrack filled with classic throwbacks, and the climactic bloody showdown in Dalton's house against the Manson members was decently entertaining to watch, but aside from that this entire movie was a bit of a let down.  I liked the somewhat love letter to classic Hollywood cinema that's spread throughout the movie via iconic actors and characters from the past as well as the impressive re-creation of the 60's time period.  Overall, this wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I've no desire to revisit this as opposed to his earlier, greater works(not including Death Proof).\n",
            "So B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!\n",

            "#IMDb #MovieReview 3,5 ⭐️ Falida, Judy vai a série de shows em Londres, longe dos filhos e em crise consigo mesma. Renée Zellweger (merecedora do Oscar mesmo) arrasa. Mas do filme em si, não dá para dizer o mesmo.\n",
            "It's bad. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎\n",
            "Fabulous dahling, simply fabulous. Renee Zellweger deserved all the accolades for her performance. Just wanted to jump through the screen and slap her silly. It was criminal what the movie studios did to her. My favorite part was when she was was cooking the \"omelet\" with the two guys and when they and other audience members stood up and sang along with Over the Rainbow.\n",
            "Very good but wish it had more then the last few months of her life fantastic performance by Renee \n",
            "I think Renee did well here capturing the essence of Judy but the movie itself was flat and frankly treated Judy a bit one dimensionally. Judy deserves a better story for a performer who really was loved by so many. I’d recommend watching Me and My Shadows with Judy Davis for a clearer picture of Judy Garland. While I also think Renee did better on the singing than I thought nothing beats Judy’s voice and not having in this film was a bit of a hole. \n",

            "For me, the retelling of Judy's childhood were the standout moments as they really show what an odd childhood she had, which helps us understand why is was like she was throughout her life. An interesting film, I enjoyed it, was it amazing? I don't think so, but if you like Judy, or are even just mildly curious - its worth watching.\n",

            "Performances are all outstanding, but it's not a movie. It's more like HBO.\n",
            "It is a good film for the content. An interesting story which would have been a good documentary, but had to be presented as a drama because of legal stipulations which the film goes into but never explicitly addresses.\n",
            "The movie is poor. Does not set a tone and I found it also pretty superficial. Only the cause, the good intentions and a lot of famous actors elevate this production. (which, I guess, sometimes is just enough)\n",

            "Like an actual Elton John concert (I've been to two and he's one of the most incredible showman ever), you will hear every Elton hit you want with energy and great effects, the only problem for me is that this kept the movie from getting really deep into his story. He's had a life full of drama - up and down,  and maybe to get it all in to a neat package a lot of that gets skimmed over. Taron Egerton is good, and the over-the-top costumes and choreography do make it a spectacle to behold.\n",
            "It was a fun spectacle, exactly what you would expect from a movie about Elton John. I liked the structure of the story but it was definitely the fast forward version of his life. I thought it could have dug a little deeper. Great music and Egerton was solid. (67%)\n",
            "The formulaic music biopic has a new flavor and style. The way we see the music of Elton John's career strung into his life events and play out is fascinating. Coming from a huge Elton John fan I may be biased, but Ray, Bohemian Rhapsody, and even Walk the  Line are all fighting for second now in my mind.\n",
            "Holy hell where do I start with how amazing this movie is?, it is my second favourite it's a must see no matter what 5/5 10/10\n",
            "I loved it. It was so creative\n",
            "Rocketman not only acquaints (or reintroduces) you with Elton John's music but also the artist behind the hits, spending time on crucial biographical details while also boldly showcasing his dreamer persona. At the heart of all the drugs, glamour and tunes is Taron Egerton, who turns in a scenery-chewing performance.\n",

            "American Factory is one of the greatest documentaries I've ever watched, and provides refreshing new perspectives to the radical effects of globalization in the United States. The film does an incredible job of showing the Chinese and American viewpoints equally as both groups adapt to their new circumstances. Like many \"East meets West\" types of documentaries, I finished the movie with a prevailing sense that the two groups are similar in more ways than they are different, which gives me hope amid the negative portrayals so common in the media.\n",
            "Really good, a grower that leaves you thinking long after it's done.\n",
            "American Factory offers a fascinating look into this working environment where two very different cultures are thrust together, and how the two ultimately clash in ideologies and work ethic. It's very well directed and quite inspirational at times. But its fly on the wall narrative choice did lead to a very dispassionate, highly unopinionated movie which is odd for a documentary feature. Thus, it was a solid, but safe choice for the Oscar.\n",
            "Seems like the documentarians gave up at the end. It seems like automation was a major factor in the story of the factory. The ending of the movie suggests that the main reason why the factory became profitable (and as a result stayed in the US) was due to automation, but they didn't talk about automation or the effect it had on the company or the workers. It seems like it didn't fit into what the documentarians wanted the story to be about so they glossed over it.\n",
            "The Documentary is awsome. It told a very complex, full-scale story that full of cultures, conflicts and negotiation. Thought-provoking.\n",
            "The Oscar winning documentary tells the story of a closed Dayton, Ohio, GM plant taken over by a Chinese company and the clashes of the two cultures concerning workers.  The last part deals with the unsuccessful vote to have the plant unionized with a 60% no vote.  Of course the union organizers and supporters were eventually gone from the factory.  It is a tough pill for workers who were making over $25 an hour to a beginning salary of $14 an hour or approximately $28,000 a year.\n",

            "Great story-telling and arrangement of structure, the director tells culture clash and the most sensitive relation between the states and China; and most of all, it depicts certain thoughts that the Chinese will perceive towards the american from the bottom of their heart due to the culture which they learn from the beginning.\n",
            "This film could have been more interesting if it were 30min. in length. It was a completely unwatchable waste of time.\n",
            "Really good food for thought on the future or industrialization and how to blend cultures.\n",
            "American Factory is a troubling look into the potential future of modern work. I loved the subtle almost old-fashioned observational style that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions. The scenes filmed in China were truly eye-opening....\n",
