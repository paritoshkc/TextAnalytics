Simply awesome, a new thing... great! A must see
One of the best movies in recent memory, Moonlight perfectly captures a relevant topic about African American gay youth and the discrimination they face, and how it shapes their lives, with an amazing story, making the viewer become emotionally attached to Chiron. Barry Jenkins shows his brilliance as a director with ana amazing screenplay, but what stands out is the amazing cinematography and the way many scenes are beautifully shot, but also hold a deeper meaning tied into both the social commentary but also the aspect of the characters psychological state. It is truly fascinating. The acting is flawless. This is one of the greatest acted movies I have ever seen. All Chiron Performances are amazing.  Alex.R Hibbert has an amazing, powerful performance at a young age, showing that he is destined for greatness. Ashton Sanders captures teenage Chiron, someone who is beginning to find out who he is but has to deal with homophobia and a troubled household perfectly. Trevante Rhodes perfectly shows an Older Chron, someone who is trying to hide his identity and gives one of the best performances in the entire film. Naomie Harris is outstanding as Paula, Chiron's mother, who struggles with addiction, and has a love for her son but values her need to self medicate more than anything. Mahershala Ali wins a well deserved Oscar for his performance as Juan, who in just over 30 minutes of screentime, gave what might be the best performance in the film. Despite being a dealer, he proves to be an important figure in shaping Chiron, but it also leaves the viewer with a conflict, as they know Chiron's mother is a bad influence, but to escape it he meets Juan, who also seen later in the film, led Chiron in his same footsteps as a dealer, or one can say it is fate, just one of the many psychological questions this film asks. This is one of the best supporting performances of the last decade. Jharrel Jerrome is great as teen Kevin, and Andre Holland is great as older Kevin. The side characters from the bullies, to the teachers, to the counselors are all amazing as well. If anybody wants to see amazing acting, beautiful cinematography, in a brilliantly written film about an extremely relevant social topic, this is the film to see.
i just don't know how Mahershala won the oscar and the end is meh
Wow this movie was great I absolutely loved it the emotion was there the acting beautiful this definitely gets an A+
Moving film with great performances and cinematography
Way late to the party on this one I know. This movie is so surreal, a deep dive into the gay experience via the African American community that I have no tangibility to. I found myself so attached to the Chyrone character after he pays dreadful consequences for just being himself one time. 

Amazing performance, a few years after it comes out I have no idea why Barry Jenkins isn't getting more work. 

This film really stands apart from all other typical LGBTQ movies.
It gives an extraordinary story but acting wasn't the best.
"3 Act structure," It better be the most emotional, painful, time in the characters life. I need to feel the emotion. I need that confrontation with your mother about the abuse and the neglect. I need you to make me feel the pain you feel everyday. Make me feel isolated as you did in school. Let me grow with you as a character. Make the shots resemble that growth, as the character grows and develops as do the shot stabilize and lighting seems not as harsh. As dose the world not seem as harsh and cruel anymore. Either I'm growing with you or I am not. One of the biggest events in the characters life, the death of a man that fed him and raised him could have been a symphony of emotions. Yet you chose to give us a back story you'll never use. Which is the biggest mistake in the film. How I'm I going to get emotional when I only have pieces of a story? I don't need another walk around film. I need connection, emotion, Life and death, the struggles defeating the demons. Because if you can't defeat them. How am I going to? We connect with the hero's journey because it gives us hope. Give me hope! Not just moments in your life. Show me the gold at the end of the rainbow.
Wanted to love this like so many others but just didn't work for me.
You MUST see this movie!! It is a pinnacle of cinema with awe-inspiring performances, brilliant writing, and amazing directing! How this doesn't already have a 100% or, at the very least, a 99% on this site completely boggles my mind!
I guess some people are just too excited about LGBT+ movies. It keeps you entartained.
Sorry, this really didn't work for me, just found it tedious 
Good acting but it was a bit boring for me
No way La La Land even comes close to this movie. The movie plays like a slow and sad symphony that blossoms into something more beautiful.
Touching story driven by dialogue. The character development is amazing. Huge stride for LGBT in cinema.
A masterpiece that makes you feel for the character. The separation into three parts was a great idea, and it conveys its message. It shows Chirons development in a way that makes you feel for him, hard. It shows you the worst moments, and the outcome in the end, wraps it all up perfectly, he truly finds himself
Very emotional and heart-breaking story.
A young gay boy tries to come to terms with himself against a backdrop of bullying and intolerance. Beautifully shot and well acted throughout, but also incredibly slow and ponderous which won’t be to everyone’s taste. I thought the young kid and the teenage actor both played the character really well, but I was less convinced by the adult version for some reason. The emotions are strong in this film and you really care about the characters. A well made film, but from an entertainment point of view it’s not one I’d want to watch again and again.
An really incredible but also small micro crosm story about a boy in a society full of failures
Beautiful and poetic.
'Moonlight' (2016) - This film is utterly flawless. A24 in my opinion is a breeding-ground for near-perfect films, and this is one of the few that have actually turned out perfect. Everything from the screenplay, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, I was simply taken by all of it. There are few films that can hypnotize me and and keep me in its grasp from beginning to end, and this is one of those films. It is so subtle, and yet so powerful. It's not a movie that lets its actors goes over-the-top with emotion, but rather the opposite, keeping it bottled up and that makes it all-the-more realistic. As I mentioned, each performance given in this movie is impeccable. So many moments gave me chills and moved me to my core. I've never been so invested in a character-study movie before, and I find myself rewatching it over and over again, each time it getting better and better, picking up more slight details along the way. Easily one of the best movies of the 2010's, and of the best character-piece movies of the 21st century thus far, in my opinion.
10/10
The plot moves at a slow pace, and the movie is boring. The movie is so overhyped that it is destined to disappoint.
A movie that helps define a decade: race, sexuality, identity, and most importantly, the blessed state of filmmaking today.
Tremendamente sobrevalorada. Devuelvan el Oscar a La La Land
Great acting, great story. The soundtrack was one of my favorites of all time
There were a lot of pros and cons to this movie for me. I think it's best I list them out.

PROS:
- absolutely beautifully shot (especially the monologues with disconnected sound and picture)
- structure was interesting and made it very easy to navigate
- second act was a huge highlight for me
- unique classical score that set a totally different tone from the cliche (where the cliche might have been hip-hop songs)

CONS:
- third act was a bore in my opinion
- I'm not a fan of giving such huge emphasis on race and identity in movies (people should be portrayed as who they are as naturally as possible, or else it gives rise to stereotypes and outdated movie tropes)
- the deliberate partitioning of the three acts made me want more out of the story. I love coming-of-age films, but leaving out the transitions between adolescence -> teen and teen -> adulthood was a little disappointing to me. And the sections can give us room for imagination, but the pacing made it hard for me to keep my interest in Chiron's development.
I still prefer La La Land as the best film from 2016 but this is tremendous. Great acting, stellar writing, and a story that touches on a lot of important topics.
Heartbreaking, poignant, impactful.  Moonlight is a beautifully tragic coming-of-age story that needed to be told.
Overhyped and forced , this film could have used some more dialogue and a louder audio track for that dialogue. Minimalism is a great artistic tool, it just doesn't work with this script.  And with the best scene being when Little smashes a chair over the head of one of his bullies, that says alot for a movie that covers so many important topics - where the most entertaining scene can be found on a WWE pay-per view.
Exquisite. A masterpiece. This film will stay with you.
I honestly loved it. My favorite characters were/ still are Chiron and Kevin.
I am probably the only one who actually didn't enjoy watching the movie. Mahershala Ali is the only good thing in this movie. Usually when we are watching a movie we expect a slow start and then much more emotion, a climax after a few minutes. Moonlight takes you through a good start to a boring ending. They killed Ali character after 30 minutes of movie and then you have to watch one hour slow dialogues.
This movie is incredibly beautiful and emotionally honest. A great deal has already been said about its impactful and telling portrayal of masculinity and emotional vulnerability, and how incredibly important this movie is. The actors were all stellar and felt very true to their characters, and the progression of the film was completely satisfying. This film makes you feel something deep within your chest, pain and joy, and underneath it all hope, that is rare and special in art. For any person who grew up as a child vulnerable and isolated, lonely and struggling, this will feel like an honest reflection on pain and hope.
Stunning. Beautifully shot.
Unbelievable.   Nicely filmed, but ponderous, slow, not particularly well-acted (although it brought 'sulking' to a new level), I wanted to like the film, but it just went nowhere.  While I can understand others enjoying it more than I, THIS is the film that won won Best Film of the Year?    Huh?   Unbelievable.....
If you like artsy movies this one is bit above average.
Excellent film. A genuine and sentimentally touching story about a gay black man growing up in a world of adversity, yet ultimately ending in triumph and hope.
this movie comes up when I search top rated/best movies of all time. absolutely no. it's fine but nothing special
Honestly the reason audience score is so low is because y'all are just straight homophobic. Such a beautiful and IMPORTANT movie. Super realistic also
Great picture, great actors, great emotion.
Worst movie I have ever seen.
Raw, intimate, powerful. Complete triumph of style. 
A really well done movie. The first 1/3 was absolutely phenomenal and set the pace and tone. The remaining 2/3 were good, but didn't quite meet the lofty expectations. Ali is a damn good actor.
An amazing character study that plays itself off subtle but so profound.  A true gripping coming of age story
The amount of work and thought that went into each and every frame is insane. This film is extremely meaningful and a beautiful story overall. It is not your typical "Hood" movie. The sound design matches the story in a oddly good way, that no movie has ever done before. Only downside of this film is it gets a teeny bit slow toward the end. 
A Masterpiece in portraying the struggle of sexual identity
Simply lacks the qualities and writing of a good film. Political bait. 
Not sure how this got 98% from the critics. 

Very heavy handed with little craft. 
you know how you can spot a good movie try to watch it twice without falling asleep with this one I fell sleep the first hour in to it 
A lot of people loved this movie (obviously, since it won Best Picture). I admired the filmmaking, but didn't really connect with it. I thought some parts were very slow, especially the scene in the restaurant near the end. I didn't think the third section was as effective as the first two. The child actors are all really good, and I think anyone who has experienced bullying at school can relate to what Chiron goes through. It's not an easy watch and wasn't really for me, but I can see why some people love it.
Not only the best film of 2016, but one of the best films of the 21st century. 
Mahershala Ali is pretty good on it, but the story isn't as interesting as I would thought. But at the same it's good to see small budjet films doing well. Altought, politics a side, it's no Oscar material.
It's a well shot movie that partly feels like it was too obviously written for the critics. If you break the story down to the essential, you'll find too many "play-it-by-the-book sentimental drama" clichés and hardly anything surprising or new.
Such real and original story. Hit right in the feels
Absolutely incredible acting.
Motion pictures like Moonlight are the reason why cinema exists.
Overrated shit.Boring,weak film,but this film has only one plus and it`s a visual perfection.3 out of 10
Moonlight is is excellent and well put together. This movie proves how hard it can be to grow up in an environment where you may not be accepted. 
Very boring movie, nothing happens. Very slow.
Taking a look at a coming-of-age story that is as special as it is powerful, Moonlight exquisitely represents two underlooked communities with authenticity and impeccable work from every single person involved. Incredible performances and an outstanding score are two of the things that make this even more emotionally impactful, while it also is visually beautiful, its raw and heartwarming depictions, such as love and types of abuse, are what make this film captivating and shocking, giving audiences a very bittersweet experience that sometimes may not be for the faint of heart, but that it eventually rewards with a heartfelt story.
A hard movie to watch, but it needs to be. Moonlight really takes on a narrative that is original and powerful.
So well acted and written. Incredible movie
Well done and brave. Great acting. What keeps it from a better rating is that it (even as an Indie) falls into stereotyping. Wouldn’t this be far more moving and real if the kid grew up to be average looking, maybe with weight issues, etc....? But no... the gay black kid has to grow up to be a muscular black stud, and the camera fetishizing him with lingering shots over his torso. 
Touching but didn't meet my expectations and doesn't reach its potential.
No la vean ni de chista, aburrida y con poco sentido.
Wasn't what I thought it would be but it's still a solid film.
Beautiful coming of age story about vulnerability and the intersectionality of race, sexuality, economic status and age. Great representation on life. Plus the cinematography was perfect. Only downside was it was a little slow. (85%) 
I don't really understand why this is the oscar winner for best film 🤢
It's not the best one to entertainand it's probably overrated, but the actors do well their job making the characters introspective
This was one of the most beautifully photographed, superbly set, and genuinely authentic films I've ever seen. Jenkins established a time and place perfectly, and told such an achingly honest and unsparing story of identity and self-awakening, it's almost like poetry. The use of a steadicam instead of a handheld gave it an uncommon grace and dignity which added to its authenticity. This is a movie I won't soon forget.
The two time jumps in Moonlight are significantly difficult to overcome; especially the latter. Once Barry Jenkins finally gets you hooked on of the three stages of Chiron, he jumps to the next and just like that all traces of the last age flash are completely erased. Now with this said, Moonlight is still a decent movie, mainly because of Chiron's second age flash. I also would've enjoyed Moonlight much more if at least they would've made Chiron's third age flash slightly entertaining. I was bored out of my mind watching Chiron's third age flash and kept waiting for something significant to happen, but at the end of Moonlight I was left with a bland, boring taste.
I won't deny its importance, but if this is the film that beat out La La Land as best picture... I guess I was expecting something more. Mahershala Ali was so good, and I wish he had more to do in this one. As a film-lover, I was so disappointed that I didn't love this movie.
A wonderful original film, that leaves you with hope and happiness.
This is not a very different kind of hood movie. It focuses on the tough upbringing of a boy in the streets of Miami, rather than a lot of street violence and drugs. There isn't actually as much going on as you would expect. And some moments are long. But Moonlight manages to also have some powerful moments, and the cast are all pretty good. It deals with themes such as homosexuality, Afro-American identity and social classes. Which is why it won the Academy Award for beat picture. It's a sometimes touching flick and overall a good and very smart movie. Recommended!!
One of the best LGBTQ+ movies ever!
Touching, but I couldn't help but feel like something was lacking in this movie.
How the hell did this get an oscar?
The SAG screener came out for MOONLIGHT.  Yet another boring film being hyped for the Oscars.  Painfully predictable.  EVERY black stereotype and cliche is dragged out before us, one by one.  This film tries to do too much, yet covers zero original ground.  For those who measure the value of a project in diversity, this lacks it ENTIRELY, being set in Miami, yet does not have a single white or Hispanic cast member.  The only white people I recall seeing in the whole film were two background actors eating at a diner.  I do not recall a single Hispanic, even as background.  IN MIAMI.  It tells a threadworn tale we've seen done better before.  MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is a wild car chase compared to this (It is also a FAR better film).  Pulled in $11MM against a $5MM budget.  That's a wash or a loss, folks.  Incredibly, rated 98/90.  That's rated better by critics than THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  (91/98).  The world has gone mad.  *.5/*****.
I honestly don't know why it got the best picture. I mean yes, it's most definitely a great movie, but the pacing of the movie is just a little slow but at the same time the boy's life, who we're journeying along with just goes too fast. The characters are a tad unlikable too. 9.2/10
A meandering often amateurish overrated waste of time.
ok, um filme que aborta diversas questÃµes polÃªmicas. tudo isso, procurando evidenciar a construÃ§Ã£o e certa e evoluÃ§Ã£o de um personagem. atÃ (C) aÃ­ tudo bem, mas termina nisso. narrado de forma levemente sucinta e poÃ (C)tica, nÃ£o hÃ¡ nada alÃ (C)m de um roteiro equilibrado e boas atuaÃ§Ãµes. Ainda assim, acho super avaliado demais para os elogios rasgados em demasia.
THIS MOVIE AWOKEN SOMETHING IN ME THAT I THOUGHT I HAD BURIED LONG AGO.  THANK YOU MOONLIGHT
Expands the stories of LGBTQ stories in america. Really cool, passionate, intimate storytelling.
As a guy who didn't like Boyhood, I feel like Moonlight, another film about a boy growing up, was infinitely better.

Boyhood explored every single detail about Mason's life, and many of those details don't translate well as a narrative. Many plot points would be quickly forgotten and were never referenced again.

Moonlight only shows three parts of Chiron's life, but those three parts are the most vital to the plot. This creates a narrative that is very engaging.

Another thing I didn't like about Boyhood was that it shoved in a bunch of pop-culture references that were really dated by the time the film hit theaters.

Moonlight never quite specifies when it takes place, making the film feel more timeless as the years go by.


I know a lot of people really loved Boyhood, but I personally think Moonlight was a much better film on just about every level. The characters are more interesting, the story is very interesting, the editing is beyond genius, and overall, I feel that Moonlight will hold up in the years to come.
This is one of the more interesting Best Picture winners that I have ever seen, it's a story about underprivileged African-Americans that is not seen through a white lens. There is no black and white in this film, those who treat the main character with love and care are complicit in the abuse of others and that makes a very complex film. Having recently seen If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) it was rewarding to look back at Barry Jenkins' breakout film and see all of the flourishes that make him such a unique director. Thank goodness that this and not the cringe worthy and forgettable La La Land (2016).

We see a man Chiron,, at three different stages in his life as he progresses from troubled child with an abusive mother to confused homosexual teenager to emotionally neutered adult. The figures surrounding him who most matter are his drug-addicted mother, Naomie Harris, his childhood mentor, Mahershala Ali, and his high school friend,,. His mentor tries to teach him how to live a moral life but Chiron ends up following in his footsteps and becoming a drug dealer himself whilst his friend gives him a hand job on the beach but later beats him up after facing peer pressure. All of the abuse he has faced in his life lead to him becoming a man who directs all of his energy into exercise and the illegal activities that help him earn a living whilst having no outlet for his sexual frustration.

What makes the film special is that these people are seen as just that normal people, not slaves or slightly simple but innocent folks who need to be helped along by an intellectually superior white person. Chiron faces many difficulties in his life a lot of which are probably influenced by racial inequality in the United States but racism is not the focus of the story instead we see his troubled coming of age in a black community in which complex figures exist. Teresa, Janelle Monae, is a kind, motherly figure that Chiron can look up to instead of his own abusive, troubled mother. We see two very different women, both black, with major supporting roles who both have significant flaws whilst also having redemptive moments. This sort of nuance is not present in The Help (2011) or The Blind Side (2009) in which African-Americans are reduced to supporting players who need the help of Emma Stone or Sandra Bullock.

The presence of an extremely quiet, self-contained lead character could have made the film difficult to engage with but fortunately all three actors who portrayed the main character were very good at conveying internal strife. In particular,, was able to capture his character's ambivalence about his sexual attraction to his best friend. The actors manage to make their version of the character feel like a natural progression instead of feeling like a completely different interpretation this means that emotional moments have more impact as we have sympathy for that little boy on the beach when we understand that Chiron has become as bad as his mentor.

If I had any criticism of the film, I have very little, I would say it's a fairly ugly film and I understand that the location that Chiron lives in is either rough or just dull but I still believe that more effort could be put in to add something to visual style of this film. In Knight of Cups (2015), a very different film I know, Christian Bale or Rick, as his character is known, visits Skid Row one of the roughest neighborhoods in the United States and yet through the lens of Emmanuel Lubezki there is a strange beauty to it. Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers working today and not every film is going to look as beautiful as something directed by Terrence Malick but you would still hope for something approaching grotesque beauty.

This was definitely a deserving Best Picture winner as it was much better than any of the other films nominated that year but I personally preferred Manchester by the Sea (2016). Kudos to the Academy for rewarding a non-white savior narrative film about people of color, it's about damn time, but it's rather disappointing to see them regress with Green Book (2018).
I know why it is relevant, I know why it is praised, and I know it is not my kinda movie.
boyhood: who are you?
moonlight: i'm you but stronger in every possible way
I  thought this would be a rough film to get through. Turns out it ended up being one of my favorites of the year. So simple and so complex at the same time.
I've seen Moonlight four times and I feel that this is the best film of all time. Never has anything I've ever seen come close to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins is going to achieve legendary status as a director in the near future as he wrings beauty in every scene despite the bleakest of circumstances. The three act structure is beautiful as we see a vulnerable boy who can't be himself struggle to find himself in his bleak life in working class America. It's a film unlike any other and one of the most deserved best picture winners ever. This will and always will be my favourite film and I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every single film Jenkins makes.
A heavily Oscar crafted indie film that definitely isn't for everybody. But this is what you get with company A24. The performances are spectacular, the directing is sharp, and it knows exactly what it wants to be. If your looking for those elements along with a boring film with thin consistency, no story to tell, weak writing, and characters that are difficult to relate to. Even for the LGBTs, than this is the film for you. For everyone else, it is not really their cup of tea.
Best modern movie ever created. Top 3 movies of all time. Such a powerful and moving film.
10/10 - With a terrific score, performances that are around the board Academy Award worthy, mesmerizing cinematography, and a story that made me feel heartbroken, triumphant, and just flat out happy all in the 110 minute runtime. Even when trying to look for flaws in this movie, it was very difficult to find any. One of the best films of recent years, and a very important film as well.
A broken storyline that doesn't really go anywhere 
Somewhat entertaining, but far too artsy and uneventful. How this movie won best picture is beyond me. This is not a good film.
Iâ(TM)ve seen this film one time before. I was 14. I remember thinking, âWhat did I just watch? What does this all mean?â? I was polarized. The fact that I completely understand this film two years later is beyond me. Moonlight is a deep MASTERPIECE that has to be seen to be believed. The film itself is a coming-of-age drama that unfolds in three acts: Little, Chiron, & Black. Itâ(TM)s about a young man, Chiron, whoâ(TM)s growing up in a hostile environment. The film follows his epic journey to adulthood which is lead by reinforcement, compassion, and love from surprising areas. Throughout the entire film, even into the final act of him as an adult, heâ(TM)s a shy outsider continuously dealing with difficult circumstances. There are metaphors & morals all over this film. You, as the audience, have to use your THIRD EYE like never before because there is so much to unfold, to learn, to see. The movie feels so real. EVERYONE in their acting roles were so amazing and realistic. Especially near the end of the film. I actually thought I was watching a real conversation shown in front of me. The camerawork is magnetic, glossy & raw. It added to this realistic, somber flair that is this movie. The story structure itself is so pure and natural. Itâ(TM)s like youâ(TM)re reading a book but more fluidly. Thereâ(TM)s even music that speaks to the audience and becomes integral to the storyâ(TM)s metaphors & morals. The filmâ(TM)s main messages revolve around how society itself will look at you strangely just because of who you are. You canâ(TM)t let ANYONE decide who YOU want to be and what YOU want to do. The film understands that precisely. The torment that you feel with our main character throughout is very resonant. What may seem pleasing to others when it comes to sexuality happens to be a nightmare for people like Chiron.. and MOST OF US DO NOT CARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. âIn moonlight, black boys look blueâ?. This doesnâ(TM)t mean that theyâ(TM)re sad, it means that theyâ(TM)re SPECIAL. It means that theyâ(TM)ve found something for THEMSELVES, not anyone else. They find themselves IN MOONLIGHT. Overall, Moonlight is a gut-wrenching, scary, emotional, stunningly mature film that speaks to the mind, body, & soul. 
Grade: A+
Personally I thought Harris was amazing in her role as a mother addicted to crack. Just flawless. Even the first and second Chiron's were great, but of course it is Jenkins who is the master at hand, creating a movie that had this calming quality to it yet is emotionally filled to the brim. That is truly something amazing. Too bad that this then ended on an utterly boring third act which moved so slowly. Did not like that at all.
Berï¿ 1/2 1/4hrend, toll gespielt und mehrfach zu TrÃ¤nen gerï¿ 1/2 1/4hrt. Alle Oscars die Moonlight bekommen hat, sind total verdient!
Moonlight is a very well made, beautifully shot film that is filled to the brim with great performances. It is very well paced and structured overall but some dialogue scenes do drag on a first viewing, this doesn't really affect it at all because even though the worse dialogue scenes aren't great, the best dialogue is really good and very genuine. 
This movie is one of the most genuine feeling portrayals of a person who has had a rough and lonely life.
I have to say that this film wasn't quite what I was expecting given the publicity surrounding its release. Moonlight tells the story of young, black man growing up gay in Miami set against a background of violence, neglect and drug abuse. The film is told in an episodic format, with each chapter dealing with a different point in the man, Chiron's life. It is a bleak, heartbreaking tale and central to this is a fantastic performance by Naomie Harris as his troubled mother. She stands as the central, shaping figure in Chiron's development who battles her own demons. It is her drug abuse that locks both herself and her son into a life of real sadness and deprivation. Into Chiron's life come salvation in the form of Juan (Mahershala Ali) a local figure who takes the young boy under his wing. However, he himself has a darker influence on the young man that only becomes apparent later in the movie. The cast of this film, each one of them, is brilliant, bringing to life these very real characters and their struggles. As a snapshot of a troubled and painful existence, Moonlight is a well observed study that shows that even in the darkest of narratives, there is hope for some salvation and triumph over the odds. It is a caring and solid coming of age film that is directed with a well-paced and meaningful manner that is totally absorbing.
Such a powerful and necessary movie.  So moving and thoughtful, with masculinity and race dynamics being the main themes that tie this iimportant film together. Perfection.
If every frame is a painting than this movie is the mona lisa. The cinematography in this movie has no better. Its story is believable, sadly all to realistic and one that needed to be made. Thank you barry jenkins.
It's over two years since this movie won an academy award for best picture and it's still an easily forgettable film because we have seen it so many times. Don't get me wrong it's a good film as you can see by my score but there are many other films that I remember much better in 2016 and this is the case for many films. The film is a coming of age story for a troubled youth in a violent atmosphere and his journey to be a person of character rather than a person that assimilates the nature of his environment. The most memorable performance without a doubt is Mahershala Ali who plays a father figure with his own ugly tendencies. I don't know if I would recommend Moonlight as it is a good film, but not a great one. It has great drama, but that is expected from a story like this. Still I would suggest that there are many other films to see that you will remember years later.
This movie is so boring. The plot was very bad. Only the best part of the film was the first stage of the kid with a great performance by Mahershala Ali. The rest 1 hour and a half was so boring.
Really liked the pacing. Acting was all great. Wish Ali was in it for longer.
Nothing special about it. I just saw a french film the summer before this movie and it was basically the same story, the only difference is that there are no moms on drugs and no guy randomly swimming with a small boy on the beach. Everything else is basically in the film. Disappointing that it just felt like an artsy fartsy film that had people saying the N word way too much.
This movie is the most boring movie i have seen to date. I dont see the meaning behind this pure garbage of a movie. The only reason this movie is scored high is because the main character is a gay black person.
A phenomenal film that deserves all of the praise it has recieved. It takes a realistic look at life and avoids simply showing stereotypes and hollywood cliches. Chiron is probably one of the more realistic characters ive ever seen put to film. All in all this is a well written, fantastically acted and expertley directed film! An all time classic!
I basically just don’t like coming of age stories. A24 also always leaves me needing to know more and I just don’t like that feeling. Is this about a gay guy? Is it about the life of a normal black kid growing up? 
Great performances, the film did drag on in places. Not bad for a one time watch.
It was just so boring.
you get to meet a remarkable character and as the viewer you feel truly privileged to see him grow up.  The audience is emotionally satisfied and moved by the end of the movie.
Brilliant, powerful movie. Wise, real, and sad on so many themes. The one that struck me the hardest is the plight of the bullied kid -- outcast for whatever reason -- who has no real home to go to after school for respite. It happens. Some reviewers are questioning how the ending of this movie can qualify as happy, but with this kid's start in life, even surviving is an achievement. 

All of the acting is first-rate. Mahershala Ali deserves his "Best Supporting" for a nuanced, strong performance in a role that's essential to setting the groundwork for this story, and also, let's face it, for sheer charisma, but every one else was also terrific, including Little at all his ages, Kevin at all his ages, Janelle Monae, and the heartbreaking Naomie Harris. 

This is a humanizing movie; if you have a heart at all, seeing it makes you want to give people a break when you wonder why they do the crazy or criminal things they do. That said, I'd love to see a cast this strong do a modern story mostly removed from the 'hood. The setting enhances understanding but probably also reinforces stereotypes.
Interesting and unique film Not as moving to me as I expected, but I do think it was very well crafted and deserved the Oscar. Excellent acting performances. Beautiful cinematography also.
Mahershala Ali's character was underdeveloped. He won an award for being in 20 minutes of a movie...This film felt like it was going somewhere positive, but instead ended on a note that being a drug dealer is a happy ending.
Pretty damn good movie
Tangible and touching coming of age drama contradicting existing clichees about black urban subcultures.
Moonlight: An Arthouse Masterwork. 

Review: Seen through the eyes of one man's story, Moonlight welds together a beautifully crafted character study of lives too rarely seen in the spotlight. Director Barry Jenkins' (Medicine for Melancholy) eight years in the making masterpiece finally has come alive and it's a story worth telling. The film is based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unproduced play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue; luckily Jenkins was able to get this story told to the world. Moonlight travels to new cinematic highs as we view the heartbreaking story of a young man's struggle to find himself. Moonlight is told through three different chapters of Chiron's life played by actors Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes.

Jenkins breaks up each act with a being title (i. Little, ii. Chiron and iii. Black) showing the audience what stages of life Chiron is in during that time. Each chapter is a work of art handily crafted by Jenkins himself. Throughout the film we see Chiron grappling with pain, love and his own sexuality. Moonlight is a timeless story our own human connection and finding your self-discovery in this world. Through this chronicle life of a young African-American man from adolescent to adulthood, we see Chiron trying to find his place in the world while also growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami.

Hibbert is an extraordinary actor for such a young age. With very little lines in the film, Hibbert's body language will truly move you. Chiron aka "Little" for his meek personality and size, befriends an adult named Juan (the powerful Mahershala Ali). Juan tries to be a brighter influence in "Little's" life as his mother (the magnificent Naomie Harris) continues to consume herself with drugs and alcohol. Though, only shooting her role in a matter of just three days, Harris' heartbreaking performance will leave you stunned.

One of the most moving scenes in Moonlight is when "Little" asks Juan if he is gay and how will you know? Juan simply tells him "you'll know." From there, we travel with Chiron throughout his teenage years and young adult life as he's trying to discover himself. Actors Sanders and Rhodes all excel the role of Chiron and both bring out the human inside of him. Moonlight is a revolution to the film industry as it helps shine a light in both the African-American and LGBT community. Nominated for six Golden Globes, Moonlight is an active contender this Oscars season. Barry Jenkins' newest masterpiece truly is "the story of a lifetime."
There are three amazing yet disparate movies this year that in almost any other year would win best picture hands down: La La Land, Lion, and Moonlight. By far the crudest of the three, it is the most daring artistically. I knew little about this film going in, and I was stunned by how much it moved me emotionally. It is more an art film than anything else. It breaks a lot of rules, which typically doesn’t work out so well. This was certainly the exception, and when the movie ended I knew I had witnessed the best of the three by far (having seen it last). It stands alone artistically and the characters will haunt you long afterwards. I’d give it 6 stars if I could.
If this half ass movie can win best picture than I don't know what will in the future. Anyway the only good thing about this movie other than mahershala Ali's performance was the first act, the score was beautiful and the acting was excellent but it was really boring with a weak story. So in other words it sucked.
The movie that did what Boyhood couldn't with great acting and imagery.
I can see why Hollywood loves it. But I found it boring, slow and unmoving.
"Moonlight" é um filme bem produzido, emocionante e poderoso. É impossível os mais sensíveis não soltarem algumas lágrimas...
A vitally important film that offers a powerful depiction of sexuality, masculinity, race and identity. Not only does Moonlight tackle tropes and notions rarely addressed by mainstream filmmakers but it exists also as a landmark in bringing new topics to broader audiences. With rare sensitivity, strong dialogue and beautiful cinematography this film earns the hype and icon status it has already received.
Movie made me sad :(  I felt like this story was written for me and from me. happy to find this movie on boxxy software on my audio language
This is a great butt-butt man-kiss movie
Moonlight is the tale of a urban youth and his life in 3 stages. Childhood, Adolescence, and Adulthood.  Even though this is a detailed look of life in an urban upbringing there really isn't much too the story. After it ends you are sort of left wondering to yourself.. that's it? Good acting, good stories, anticlimactic.
An emotional look into one of the most underrepresented groups in media today through a story that we can connect with universally.
Mahershala Ali stars as Chiron's guardian in this heartbreaking drama of discrimination and forbidden love.  Wish he would've been more involved in the rest of the story.
First and last act are really good, but the middle not much like other two. Great direction and cinematography.
This film grips you from the very beginning. Script, directing, acting, cinematography, music were all outstanding. The acting will blow you away. I watched it using my boxxy software. Highly recommended.
Built by strong direction from Barry Jenkins and powerful performances from an all star cast Moonlight is deep, unforgettable and powerful storytelling not seen in cinema today.
A deeply affecting narrative and fantastic performances from its impeccable cast make sure Moonlight is an unforgettable experience.
Beautiful film and so important. The performances are out of this world. Something everybody has to see.
This tone and acting in this movie is where its at.
Incredible performances. 
Very important film for today. Emotional and empathising.
10/10  Literally a perfect movie.
Made with a very simple and effective traditional 3 act structure, Moonlight tells a young boys story  growing up with such delicacy and purity that's become a rarity in Hollywood, and other indie films. Notably, I'd say only Ladybird compares in terms of the general feel and honesty of the story. The camerawork is incredibly well done, and the use of color in particular was exceptional. However, I felt for all of Moonlights brilliance, the Oscar buzz, and praise, it's too subtle and complex.  Watching the movie felt a little lethargic and I couldn't appreciate much of the techniques Jenkins used until 2nd viewing.  I feel like its hiding too much of its brilliance in the way it's been made. Moonlight is a beautiful and poetic movie ultimately, La La Land got robbed!
A moving tale that kind of drags at points, but the simple and effective ending leaves you feeling rewarded.
Tenderly heartbreaking.
It tears my soul apart.
Muy aburrida, la trama es confusa. El final con
probably watched in the summer of 2017.  Forgot to write a review. I remember it being realistic.  However, it didn't really live up to the hype.
The first two thirds are a bit of a mess but the last 'act' presents some of the most tender storytelling and acting in recent cinematic history.
I'm not a particularly emotional person and so it's very rare for a movie to really move me.  This one moved me and it stayed with me days after I watched it.  I loved everything about this film - the cast, the acting, the multiple storyline arcs and how they were developed, the shots and camera angles (raw and realistic as opposed to veneer), the beautiful visual metaphors.  I also haven't seen the coming of age story so convincingly handled by three different actors (all playing the same main character) since Cinema Paradiso.  It is breathtaking to watch a film alternate so expertly between being hard and gentle as it needs to be - Jenkins does a stellar job.
A different style of cinema

This film brings two other films to mind, 'Dunkirk' and 'Boyhood'. They both follow a life/lives without trying to make a conventional 'story' with a 3 act structure. However, out of the 3 films, that I can think of using this style, Moonlight was the only that truly blew me away. I cannot quite explain why this is the case, and why I didn't have the same connection with the other two, but, 'Dunkirk' left me emotionless, and 'Boyhood' left me bored and unsatisfied, and I felt like there was no real progression in any of the characters. Whereas, Moonlight, invoked emotion and felt incredibly authentic, due to the such real acting and directing. 'Dunkirk' felt the most artificial out of the three, I didn't connect due to their failed attempt at realism. In short, I thought Moonlight was great and recommend it to all.
Arguably one of the best films I have seen in the last 20 years. This movie's beauty is in it's quiet feel and captivating cast. Perfect in every aspect of film. Fight me.
One of a masterful piece of art in the gay society.
Seemingly gritty tales like this one are rarely told so sensitively and beautifully, but Moonlight enables us to empathise wholeheartedly with difficult characters usually presented with broad strokes elsewhere.
Poignant and beautiful in every aspect. The score is breathtaking and the cinematography is by far the best I have ever seen. 

Please watch Moonlight!!!
After watched it I said me "What a great movie that has touched many hearts... I want more movies like this!" and.... what's happened then? I met my best friend and he said me that he use boxxy software, it is for free and he can find all movies want in a great quality... I was shoked... Really... Then I try it and it's true! It's amazing software the same as this amazing movie!After watched it I said me "What a great movie that has touched many hearts... I want more movies like this!" and.... what's happened then?

One of the best movies I'Ve Ever Seen. Not what I expected.
Moonlight came out in November of 2016 and went on to win the Academy Award for best picture that year. This movie is directed by Barry Jenkins and stars a pretty solid cast, namely Naomie Harries, Janelle Monae and Madershala Ali. The movie is split into three acts and follows a young boy named Chirone and his struggles with his own identity. First things first this film has brilliant direction and it includes some all around standout performances. However, this is a movie that conflicts my own judgement and view on film and entertainment because I felt many different ways about this movie after viewing it. All around this movie is really well done. A masterfully told story with some incredible drama and some truly touching scenes. On the other hand this movie has moments where it really really slows up and doesn't quite drag on but.. it just doesn't really do anything. In that I mean this is a very realistic take on a truly touching story so in that there will be some moments that are sometimes mundane. Moonlight is a film that has stuck with me since my first time watching it and I do think about this film from time to time so it has done a good job at leaving an impact. As previously stated this film is cut into three acts and each actor that plays Chirone does a remarkable job. This movie also has some great shots and really good looking scenes. In that the cinematography is great! Moonlight is a slow burn and a very touching take on a very real story. I applaud the filmmakers for staying true to the art and making a well told story but I cannot deny the fact that this movie could've been a bit of a better watch with 15 minutes shaved off. Moonlight is a 4/5 for me!
Definitely one of the must-see American movies 2016.

Beautifully directed, with clear, yet understated point of view.
Was a great drama in which followed and unfolded the events of a young African american man having to deal with a drug addicted mother, and a post modern cruel reflective world filled with bully's and people who criticize you for being gay.Their was a scene where 2 guys get intimate so be cautious if watching with your parents.Other then that it was a very self reflecting film and helps to show how good you may have it compared to some children/people.
Barry Jenkins, screenwriter and director of the adaptation of "Moonlight," is the most recent Hollywood darling after releasing the most authentic film of 2016, portraying a side of black society rarely seen, even when it's in the backdrop of what most would imagine urban black living is like. The bold and intense movie about a boy split into showing three phases of his life is based on an intriguing story based in Miami over the past 25 or so years. It isn't, unfortunately, hard to imagine a black youth in Reagan America living in the projects without a father, living only with his crack-addicted mother, that is when she is around, and attempting as best as he can to get through school and life. What isn't common to see, however, is how said boy befriends the very drug dealer who is supplying his mother's habit and somehow becomes a part-time family with he and his girlfriend. And it isn't common to see the hard life and confusion within the young boy manifest itself into sexual introspection and the development of a spine to defend himself against bullies eager to mock his preference and social situation. The path young Chiron travels is one no one would want to follow, but some have to travel anyway. The viewer can't help but be affected by the brutal realism of his situation. The acting in this movie, specifically by the three actors who portray Chiron through life, can hardly be beat this year, but the movie isn't perfect and, thus, shouldn't win Best Picture, even though Vegas odds have it very close to the movie that should, "La La Land." The story has its choppy moments and ends rather abruptly, though it comes to resolution. I can't say where else I would have wanted the story to go and, frankly, it might have been too Hollywood if it did, but the end came suddenly for me and ended with a sweet whimper. Not to take away its importance in theme, but a perfect film, or Best Picture, it is not.
I really wanted to like this film. I'm sympathetic to what they were trying to do. But the time jumps were jarring to me and the back-stories that happened during the jumps ended the parts of the story I was most curious to see.
Shocking, yet beautiful.
Beautifully told, absorbing drama. Top notch acting from all involved. 
Emotive piece, excellent music. The starkness and acting stand out.
Very deep movie with great acting all around and a great soundtrack
Tremendous insight into real life among the unloved and disadvantaged.
Wished a lot more would have been said.
A fantastic and uniquely told story that in encapsulating and original with an amazing and peaceful score.
Adiei por um ano esse filme pensando que seria mais um drama qualquer sobre um jovem negro em um bairro pobre americano, e ainda bem que eu não poderia estar mais enganado. Fui agraciado com um dos filmes mais tocantes e sensíveis, de uma beleza única e que foge de todos os padrões de produções da mesma temática.
O primeiro aspecto que não poderia deixar de comentar são as atuações, e que escolha de casting perfeita, todos os atores entregam performances dignas de Oscar, não a toa que Naomie Harris e Mahershala Ali foram indicados e um deles até levou a estatueta pra casa. Naomie nos entrega um atuação tão real em uma personagem detestável, que percebemos o estudo e a entrega dela à sua atuação, retratando fielmente uma mulher perdida que não sabe como ajudar e reagir as escolhas do filho os mesmo tempo que luta contra seu vicio as drogas. Ali por outro lado, mesmo que na pele de um homem que era pra ser deplorável nos mostra um lado paternal e carinhoso que pode estar presente em qualquer um e somente é necessário uma oportunidade para demonstrar tais sentimentos guardados.
Mas os três atores que foram escolhidos para interpretar Chiron durante os três atos do filme dão um show a parte, criando um senso de coesão entre suas atuações realmente passando a sensação que as consequências das ações e decisões enquanto criança refletem em sua fase adulta, a dor e desamparo no olhar e até mesmo sua postura são diferentes em cada parte do filme e ao mesmo tempo são uma só, completando umas as outras.
Além das atuações impecáveis, o longa ainda conta com uma direção incrível com cenários e cores deslumbrantes, com um ótimo trabalho de iluminação e pós-produção fazendo cada ato do filme ser completamente diferente do anterior com cada vez mais cores saturadas e azuladas e que dizem muito sobre a situação emocional do protagonista e do seu ambiente. A montagem do filme é milimetricamente calculada, com todas as cenas passando alguma mensagem, nada é em vão nesse filme.
O único defeito para mim foi simplesmente o fato de faltar mais, eu queria mais do filme, algumas situações e explicações para alguns acontecimentos teriam me dado uma experiencia mais gratificante mesmo eu entendendo o que o filme queria dizer e onde ele queria chegar. Além de uma ou duas cenas que julguei desnecessárias ou sem algum significado real para a trama.
O filme é brilhante e não deve ser perdido por nada, poucas vezes vi algo tão visceral e belo na tela, Moonlight é um exercício para reflexão e para quebras de expectativas e paradigmas que consideramos como certos.
An ok film. It’s confusing you at time about his sexuality, but I guess that’s art imitating life!!! The protagonists of this film were very handsome and well casted, but I think they should of have more dialogue. It had them just wasting film at times to me!!
Hands down, one of my all time favorite films! So glad it won Best Picture! Beautiful and stunning film.
Great acting and emotional story. Was often slow and choppy. Was expecting much more.
While it certainly doesn't deserve all the praise it gets, Moolight is still good enough to be worth watching at least once.
When you go to the cinema today, you will see a trove of blockbusters, full of action and CGI. The films we consider the best of our time almost always have something to do with the level of CGI and fanciness put in through the post-production process. These movies are nearly always given either a standing ovation for the extremeness of it all or a dismissal due to over-the-top CGI. Barry Jenkins' one-of-a-kind beauty Moonlight has little to no CGI and tells a human story, rather than a superhuman story. The characters are not two-dimensional, quite the opposite. The main character's mother, Paula (played by the brilliant Naomie Harris) is an excellent example. Paula is negligent (and in some parts of the film, truly hostile) to her son, as well as being a Crack addict. But she still loves her son. The level of detail and raw emotion of the characters are the driving force of this film. The cinematography is excellent without becoming a distraction and helps enforce the story's power. Nicholas Britell's soundtrack for the film is amazing and only adds to the film. This film was truly amazing, and it deserves every award it received. A wonder like this only comes around once in a while.
Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is the absolute best film of 2016 from a year filled with incredible pieces of visual art. It is easily one of my all time favorite films. Moonlight captures the shy emotions of a young black man from Florida named Chiron. 

Moonlight is a beautiful testament to true love that spans decades. Homosexuality is an often ignored, tormented, and repressed demographic within black communities, so Moonlight is a breath of fresh air for an entire group of people. It handles a difficult subject with a subtle grace and care not regularly afforded to LGBT persons. Moonlight proudly and lovingly demonstrates how people may hide or not understand how they feel about sex and that is alright. It is a powerful message that transcends any particular sexuality, so that all audiences everywhere can empathize and relate. Moonlight is glorious.

We see him struggle to accept his sexuality as a homosexual male in the black community over 3 stages of his life. From a shy boy called Little that must survive bullies, poverty, and his negligent crack addicted mother. Chiron grows into an abused teenager seeking some kindness. Finally, Chiron matures into an adult man going by the name Black that has grown hard by his environment, the trap scene, and the prison industrial complex.

The acting within Moonlight is phenomenal! Every performance is captivating. All 3 actors that play Chiron including: Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, as well as Trevante Rhodes enthrall you the entire movie's duration. Each actor leaves an impression of deep compassion, profound hurt, and an untouched longing. Whether it is in their respective pained words or unspoken body language, these gentlemen exude their own unique take on playing timid. To portray a single person in withdrawn pain takes acting skill. Hibbert, Sanders, and Rhodes are sublime separately, while simultaneously projecting a reserved radiance. They each relate to the other performances with their eye and body movements in such a subtle way you might miss it. I look forward to seeing Trevante Rhodes in more movies after Moonlight. He has a wide emotional range that impressed me greatly.

The supporting cast is superb all around. Mahershala Ali is the perfect complex father figure. He is a caring drug dealer that is clearly trying to uplift his community while he is also a cause of its suffering. He is so sweet and smart, you will wish Ali was your father by the end. Mahershala Ali as Blue is the greatest on screen portrayal of a black father figure since Laurence Fishburne as Furious Styles in John Singleton's legendary coming of age classic Boyz n the Hood. Ali deserved his Best Support Actor Oscar as he emanates charm, decency, and kindness. Remember the name Mahershala Ali!

André Holland is so expressive as the adult Kevin. You can see how his character feels just by looking into his revealing eyes. I cannot write a review for Moonlight without mentioning Janelle Monáe's performance as the kindly Teresa. She is the sweetest character in Moonlight and absolutely charming. She embodies the spirit of motherhood. Naomie Harris is terrific as Chiron's strung out mother Paula. She is horrifying cruel, yet still empathetic by the end. You feel pity for her. Harris captures the intricate nature of Paula and how nuanced motherhood is in Moonlight.

Director Barry Jenkins is a genius. I must say Moonlight is one of the best filmed movies I have ever seen. The panning shots are so engaging. His choices for the inserts for the passage of time are endearing. Jenkins gets it all right with Moonlight. The cinematography cannot be overstated. It is gorgeous every second. Characters will be in focus in the foreground as the world disappears out of focus in the background. Jenkins has already proven he is a formidable mind behind the camera. His direction is innovative on a technical level, but also so appealing in a visual sense. Barry Jenkins is a director to watch for in the foreseeable future.

I must mention that Moonlight has the most lovely lighting from any film I can mention. It's bright and clear throughout. You will be taken aback by the color scheme as well. Red for instigators, blue for kindness, white for safety, and black for a harsh reality. It's a genius use of color as every single scene utilizes Barry Jenkins' thoughtful color palette. 

Musically, Moonlight shines with a wholly unique blend of classical cues and hip hop selections carefully chosen to best represent each scene sonically. Barry Jenkins knows how to pick them as Moonlight boasts killer rap classics from Goodie Mob to Kendrick Lamar remixes. The quieter moments are gently cradled by lush string arrangements and nestled right into your heart with a delicate elegance. It is worth listening to Moonlight's soundtrack and score on their own. You have never heard a combination of classic and contemporary harmonized for optimal atmosphere. 

Moonlight can claim its place in the hallowed halls of the fine film legacy of LGBT pictures like Blue Is the Warmest Color, Call Me by Your Name, Carol, A Single Man, and more recently, Love, Simon or Disobedience. Moonlight will only age well as its maturity, nuance, grace, humanity, and empathy are only paralleled by its technical prowess. Barry Jenkins deserved all the praise and accolades he has received for Moonlight. Moonlight earned that Best Picture Oscar.

Do yourself a favor: watch and be moved by Moonlight.
A movie is more than a movie
MOONLIGHT
Hum... it's always ungrateful for someone to write about something they don't quite understand. This week I've watched Renoir, Goddard and now Jenkins and I left each movie knowing less about film as I did walking in (though I despise Goddard). In all truth, a good movie should challenge what you believe and question your perception. So it's always emotionally tasking to rate a film that rings so personal to you, as when you critique it, you can't help to pick it apart. Moonlight is a coming of age story shot perfectly, this is where you see a director's vision coming through. As we follow Chiron as he goes from little to grown up we understand gradually more about his mind and personality. We see, before our eyes, the character evolving and changing in ways that Boyhood never quite acomplishes, for example. Chiron is played beautiful by the three actors who have equal meritt in portraying him in a way we don't stop feeling his essence. Future Oscar winner Mahershela Ali is a knock out alongside Janelle Monae but enough praise can't be given to Naomie Harris who, after the crapfest Collateral Beauty, gives a complex and enthralling portrayal of a drug adict. The soundtrack is one of the most perfect (if not the most) of the year, it grips you, haunts you and it complements the movie with grace. The cinematography is a perfect fit for Jenkin's direction - with expressive use of depth of focus and and the shifting of focal points beyond what's obvious. Also, the use of color cannot be understated, with one of the best deliveries of color mainly through light cinema has ever seen. The only thing I'd rule against is its overuse of flares, which is a matter of personal taste more than anything. Overall, the cinematography is a extremely lenghty home run, Jekins can make wiping jizz in the sand seem beautiful. Structurally is flawless and its editing and script are two feats of filmmaking. I'd argue that it looses steam in the third act and the end could have been worked on, yet I can't say many more cons. In the end, the subject matter hit me hard as I could see myself in many ways in Chiron. Watching him try to come to terms with his homossexuality and being bullied are things that didn't happen to me but could easily have. Most moments in first two acts seem like a succession of blows that brought me to tears and caused me to be on the edge of my seat. I don't remeber a recent time when I rooted so much for a character. It's a heartrenching movie that all should see. It's these kind of films that the Academy should recognize! This film is why I go to the movies!
27million boxoffice. It won academy  award.  Emoji movie 86 million box office. won razzi award.
Intense, gripping but uncomfortable and ending was anticlimatic. Plus how likely is it for someone to not only go from scared and bullied to trappin' but also from skinny to P a million X in a few years.
This was a beautiful movie, but it did not have a plot. Instead, this was a movie that followed our character Chiron/Black over three different decades. It's a very touching film and interesting, but the entire time I was trying to find what was going on. It's a good film, but I'm not sure if I would watch it again.
Every line in this movie was pure gold.
Moonlight is a modern masterpiece. The story may seem simple and familiar, but it is told in an extremely powerful way, addressing themes like masculinity, identity, love, race, class, and parenting, all told in a visceral way that makes the setting come to life through the eyes of the highly relatable outsider. I have no complaints about this film as I still can't get it out of my head. There is and has never been anything like Moonlight.
Little, Chiron, Black.
One of the best movies I’ve ever seen! 
Haunting, beautiful, perfect
Emotional, enduring...This one got to me. 
It's not an enjoyable movie. Not because it's bad. Because it's so real and too deep. A flawless movie that definitely isn't for everyone.
It was a beautiful story and it told the story really well. I also appreciate the timely subject matter. Still, I kinda wish La La Land won instead... (sorry!)
Praised by colleagues I gave it a try but found it unrelatable and kind of a stretch on reality
Beautiful, sensitive and  sad. I think it's a masterpiece.
Such a boring movie, and I’m from Miami. It’s great to stand up for minorities and homosexuality, but a movie should stand out on its own. I would gladly take back the time I wasted watching this film regardless of the opinions of others.
To start off, I just want to say that this is my favourite movie of all times. After watching it for the fourth time, I feel the need to really analyse this movie with everyone and try to understand the importance of this movie. This movie largely talks about Black Masculinity and the dealing of homosexuality around a homophobic environment.
I. Little: Starting off the movie with one of the key issues within Chiron's life, his mothers addiction to heroin. After running into the abandoned house, he finds a crack pipe on the floor, it is also the starting point of when Little finds out about what his mother is dealing with and what an impact its having on his life. Juan meets him within that same house, breaking loose the wood panels over the windows, uncovered by light almost as his guardian. While eating lunch, it seems as if Chiron receives his first apology from someone, after he looks up at Juan after giving back his food. Even during his playtime, he stands there looking at other boys play and it is a simile of how some gay people might feel, he stands there feeling like he's from the outside looking in, outside the box and not really fitting in within a category of people that he have met before. The sheer attention to detail that has been given by Barry Jenkins is incredible, and props to the cinematographer as well for their beautiful imagery that they have portrayed here. The music of course is also worth a mention, as this piano work has stuck with me and other vintage records pulled up here clicked right into place. Within the first chapter you can see his first steps into strengthening of character. From Juan he receives his first male support and starts feeling more safe, when letting go in the water. He only manages to let go when everyone else around him are free, during dance, you can truly see his feeling of freedom for that split moment. Actors within each role have played SUCH a strong part and would not change them for anyone else. Really it was so impressive and so touching. Even within the first chapter you can notice some bullying but it gets more intense during his teenage years in chapter II.
II. Chiron: You can notice his struggle to talk about heterosexuality when his only friend Kevin starts speaking to him, he is just lost for words and not necessarily comfortable with the subject. He carries his confined personality through his life as a means for people to not be able to see him for what he really is. It is very saddening but true what you see on the screen of the stress of a child, seeing what his mother is going through and being completely helpless. After going through a tough period, that is what the chapter ends with, enough is enough and Chiron tries to deal with his bullies.
III. Black: Within this chapter you can see the re-occurring theme of what happened in the end of chapter II, where he likes to feel the cold, dipping his face into an ice filled sink. In this chapter you can see the 'new him' not necessarily the 'real him'. He has created this persona based on his mentor Juan, replicating his style, car, lifestyle and even the crown on the dashboard of his vehicle. After receiving a call from Kevin, that is when his breakthrough of the thug characters takes place, finally being touched by someone emotionally. After walking into the cafe, you can really tell the difference in mood and lighting, the unfolding of CHIRON really takes place. Even while speaking to Kevin and being confronted with 'This is not you' he responds in a negative way, being scared to open up, after building this strong character for so long. Kevin continues to perform his embarrassed head shake that he does after making an embarrassing joke. His reflection of past can even be noticed on his car, when he drives off with the licence plate reading 'BLACK035'. When they arrive, he feels the breeze of the waters. He gets questions 'Who is you?' and that's when Chiron really needs to let his feelings out. Ending the movie, them finally being re-united again, the image of Little being back by the water communicates his feeling of Peace, feeling like he is back to what he always felt IS him.
Definitely better than La La Land. Mahershala Ali did a lot less than I expected given all the awards, but Im surprised it didnt pick up the Oscar for directing, or at the very least, cinematography, which was beautiful and striking and pretty stunning throughout.
Horrible. Terrible. Nothing to like about it.
So-so movie, I felt like I was watching Boyhood but with black people. There really is nothing memorable about this film. The performance by Mahershala Ali was the best part about this movie.
Awful movie,  and I don't find many that I call awful. Just because a movie wins awards does not mean it is good.  And that's the case here.  I asked for my money back and have never done that
I thought it was "meh"...
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
A haunting film that stays with you, long after you leave the cinema.
Fantastically directed and beautifully shot with a striking use of colour and music, 'Moonlight' is one of those rare films that captures the essence of something special, relating its tale in a way that casts a spell on its audience. Following the life of someone who is seen to be a little different, we see him go from a boy to a man and how his experiences, the good and the bad, have shaped him. Outstanding performances from all involved rounds things off, making this an incredibly engaging film in more ways than one, giving us an insight into the lives of those who are not often seen on the silver screen.
A wonderful film - there was so much to it. The colours, the music and the brilliant acting. Mrs B hated it.
Moonlight is one of the heart touching movies I have ever seen. Its simple and beautifully written.
4 out of 5 stars! This was a very good and powerful film! I can see why it won best film at the Oscars last year. Good acting, good writing, good cinematographer, and important messages conveyed throughout.
As tender as it is tough as it is true, three-tiered coming-of-age drama Moonlight is a near-master class character study that almost reaches the vaunted heights of its A+ reputation. 

In this R-rated Oscar winner, director Barry Jenkins chronicles the childhood, adolescence and burgeoning adulthood of a young, African-American, gay man growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami. Truly, in any other year or awards cycle, this film might have found itself in the also-ran category. Given the backlash surrounding the 'Oscars So White' brouhaha, however (in which the Motion Picture Academy of Arts & Sciences barely put forth any African-American nominees), this independent gem improbably claimed the year's top prize. To say that Academy voters gave Moonlight the Best Picture trophy due to white guilt or a self-back-patting PR-move truly undermines a beautifully acted and shot achievement in filmmaking. However, the truth is that Moonlight is good but not THAT good. Weighing the film with these heaviest of laurels only serves to put an albatross around its neck, dashing expectations along the way and undermining its beauty in another way. At times heart-tugging and heart-wrenching (sometimes at the same time), there are many things to love about Moonlight, beginning with its source. The film takes its inspiration from In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, an unpublished play by Tarell Alvin McRaney, in more ways than one. Beyond the title and narrative, there is also the matter of color. Almost everything - from the rolling surf where a fatherly drug dealer takes young Chiron for his first ocean dip to the clothes worn by a teenage Chiron's abusive mother to the streetlights of nighttime Miami where a hardened adult-aged Chiron peddles narcotics - exudes an almost ethereal blueish hue. And that's the splendor of Jenkins and cinematographer James Laxton's unified vision. Life is not simply black and white; it's black and blue--dark moments punctuated by color. Just look at the film's poster, which showcases the three faces of Chiron as one in stark black and blue. The vicious visceral sense of the term 'black and blue' in regards to bruising only compounds this notion. Notice too that these aforementioned scenes also bely this duality. In these highlighted moments, there's the hurtful but loving mother, the kind-hearted but socially despicable father figure and our protagonist, a lost little boy grown into a callous criminal. There are colorful qualities to these often-dark lives, which is definitely an authentically human quality. Thankfully, Jenkins and Laxton capture this all in a truly cinematic fashion, forgoing handheld in lieu of a good old-fashioned stationary camera. It exudes beauty in tragedy, providing the perfect backdrop as a man slowly finds himself. Alex Hibbert (Little), Ashton Sanders (Middle), and Trevante Rhodes (Big) play three versions of this same person but, together though separate, awesomely and seamlessly provide one solid and wholly believable through-line. They ARE Chiron. With little screen time, their co-stars, Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris, both leave a lasting impact felt long after the final credit has rolled. Ali, so ridiculously deserving of his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor, grounds an unlawful dealer named Juan who, alternatively, has a moral center so strong that he takes a neglected child under his caring wing. Together, Chiron and Juan truly challenge the issue of masculine identity. Again, there is that duality.

Speaking of duality, there are some slight cons. Even with all of its pluses, Moonlight has somewhat limited appeal. If you strip away the visuals (just for argument's sake, mind you), this story has already been seen and heard countless times by audiences. While it beautifully presents a real-feeling coming-of-age story, not a lot actually happens. Despite the presence of guns, drugs and thugs, it is a quiet film without a discernible plot or target audience. This is not to say that it's boring or that these are deal-breakers...at least for some audiences. Indeed, if filmgoers allow themselves to get caught up in the trappings of this story, it will move them--not overwhelmingly so but moving nonetheless. One has to truly be willing to immerse themselves in these blue waters, however, and this experience rarely exhibits a 'wow' moment. Sadly, to many, Moonlight will feel like a slow-moving lesson in monotony. 

To Sum it Up: Walk Into the Light
To be honest it's overrated. It's all political. Love the score though
Some great cinematography takes you through the emotional life of a young man.
Broken down into three chapters, chapters one and two will grab you in and bring light to a current mainstream topic. Chapter three falls short of the rest of the movie..
I'm sorry but this is not worthy of an Oscar let alone best picture. Slow, boring and uninteresting. I'm not being harsh this film does not stand up to others that have achieved its accolades, not even close.
A fantastic, beautifully told film with some masterful directing and perfect cinematography.
Incredible Character Development. Full Of Heartfelt Moments. One Of The Most Effective Coming Out Conversations I Have Ever Seen On Screen.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of the quality acting portrayed. Infact the acting was so amazing that I felt connected with certain characters like Chiron. During the more intense scenes, I hated certain characters and wanted to physically punch them.  My only complaint is the ending because I wanted to see some romance between Chiron and Kevin.
complex and emotional.
Great movie with great characters. You really get drawn in to their lives. Def makes you think about life from different angles. This movie made me feel uncomfortable and angry. I am not as forgiving. I wanted revenge.
It really brought me back to when I was young growing up in the inner city. And see the subject of sexuality in the black community as a white person is really interesting knowing the taboo of homosexuality.  Film with character who had many layers. I recommend to anyone and everybody.
I was apprehensive that this might be a blatant tearjerker or poverty safari, but it was neither, though still shocking and moving. A beautiful and dreamlike film, with extraordinarily deft characterisation, shown through action, reaction and a lot of silence.
I just loved this. The themes it explored regarding a young mans sexuality as well as growing up in a rough neighborhood were something that was hard to watch at times. Themes that have traditionally been far too unexplored in film.
Excellent cinematography as well as performances.
I'm sure there are these types of stories out in the world, different parts of the world, even in our city. I'm so limited in my perspective when it comes to the world view & cinemas often help me to empathize & understanding of it. Though, I never been gone through what the main character went through and I can see his point of view of the reason why he made the choices of what he is & why. 

A great character study film, one in which not many people will understand or want to understand. I hope that if you get to see this film, watch & go through with open mine and heart.
This is a masterpiece. This is the definition of perfection.
Moonlight was possibly the best movie I've ever seen.
The plot was fantastic and beautifully written by Tarell Alvin McCraney, in each chapter he takes us on Chiron's though life journey. This masterpiece was marvelous from the beginning to the end.
New story told. Cool more new stories
Before this film was made, the subject matter of toxic masculinity being socialized on young boys was only talked about in documentaries. When writer/Director Barry Jenkins broke this trend in 2016's best picture film there are many choices he could've made as a writer and director. By far the best decision was to keep the focus on this single universal theme and not to clutter it with others like race or socioeconomic status. Although race and poverty are there, he leaves them as expositonary background to our protagonist, not what drives the story. This helps magnify his focus on the heartache and social pressure our sexually confused protagonist feels from others. When Jenkins uses long shots and "hero" close-ups, combined with utter silence, no matter what the background of the audience member, male or female, black or white, you can't help but inject empathy into this character. This is the science of art and is executed to perfection.
The story and its subject matter is incredibly important and visually it has its moments. The soundtrack complemented it brilliantly. However, I did feel a bit *nothing* afterwards, which may be because I'm a shallow sort of movie watcher who wants to be humming a catchy tune or reliving a particularly breathtaking scene after the credits finish. 

Even so, it's a movie you should see, even if (particularly if!) you think won't enjoy it.
Very boring.  Need subtitles to hear the small amount of speech there is. No laughter or smiles. Depreessing, without hope .
An extremely mediocre film not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. It's clear the Academy was pressured by white guilt to award this film an Oscar, but nothing really adds up to such a high honor. Barry Jenkins beautifully directs; I love the staging, moments of quiet contemplation. But what does it really add up to? The film is divided into three phases of Chiron's life, but the third seems more devoted to giving this guy Kevin a second chance, and he doesn't seem like he deserves it. It was a big letdown to me, and it depicted Chiron as a weak character who is trapped and will stay trapped, as he himself even says. But the film seems to celebrate that instead of depicting the potential horror this may be. There should be a much harsher confrontation based on where they left off, and I think it would be more powerful if this was about Chiron moving on from the fact that he's never had another another lover, besides the one who beat him. Add to that our favorite character, Juan, is only in the film for the first act, and we don't get to see him again. His performance was beautiful and moving, and it would've been great to see him all the way through as a father figure. The moment between him and Chiron's mother is the most powerful scene in the movie; she's doing drugs and he's her drug dealer, but he hates to think that Chiron is going to be parented by a drug addict, despite the irony that he feeds it. She lays in to him the irony, it is hard for him to face, and he remains justified in his stance. They both love the boy in their own way. I also would like to see Teresa in the third act. It's a flat, conventional, boring story, wonderfully directed.
Went into this movie thinking I'd dislike it.  Especially given the fact that it's a story about a poor, black, gay man, I was expecting to be slammed over the head with progressive lecturing.  What an utter surprise, then, that Moonlight turned out to be a story that is, at its core, about the longing for intimacy and how that's uniquely manifested in this particular protagonist's life.  It's also got strong acting and a killer visual style, to boot.  What an absolute beauty of a film.  Truly worthy of its Best Picture win.
Película excelente, una vez la veas no la vas a olvidar
Breathtaking photography
Bittersweet romance in three stages of a young man’s life. 
BRILLIANT! If this movie doesn't make you feel with intensity every emotion a human being is capable of, you might be dead.
Mahershala Ali indeed has a good performance in this, but the real stars in my mind are the different actors who play Chiron. They do an amazing job of portraying how he changes through his life, yet each version is recognizable as the same person.
MOONLIGHT is a tragic redemption coming of age masterpiece. It is in my favourite movies of all time and while it is at times painful to watch it is one of the most superbly made movies of this generation. 
Full review is now up on Salty Popcorn.
Breathtaking. One of the best movie's I've ever seen.
I thought I was going to adore this film as it seems every news paper seems to love it, it won the golden globe for best drama. But I just didn't. In theory moonlight should be great. It chronicles the three stages of life of a closeted Black man(boy) as he deals with his first encounter with love, constant bullying and a household with a mother who does more crack than Tyrone Biggum. That sounds like a great tale, but I just didn't care. It throws you into the film abruptly and I never felt the connection to the character that I would've wished for. My favorite character is the father figure that struggles with a relationship as the mothers plug and the kids mentor. He just kinda gets written off and I think he could've been a character that could've offered so much more. I loved the score, cinematography and acting and that's the main reason for the rating I've gave it. I don't want to sound like some privileged white person but look at la la land compared to moonlight on the surface. Moonlight: a story that involves an all black cast chronicles the struggle with being a closeted homosexual. La la land: a majority white cast about a white guy who saves jazz. I'm not saying that's why so many people like moonlight but I think a lot of people wanted a change from the regular vanilla films made in Hollywood. Moonlight is good, striving aesthetically but lacks a connection to the audience that would make it a world beater.
One of the only movies I have walked out of
It's a slow burner, but worth it. The acting is excellent, the emotions raw and the music sublime. The school violence scenes were extremely gripping and moving.
Puntaje Original: 7.0

Profunda y reflexiva. Moonlight cuenta con una impecable dirección y brillantes actuaciones. Un film introspectivo, que abarca la psicología humana magistralmente, es genial, pero hecho preferentemente para audiencias más serias.
It well deserved its award. The direction is amazing. Great cinematography, score, lighting, sound and camera work: a real piece of art!
Serious, depressing type drama about a boy's life in the hood of Miami. Acting is great as per usual among Oscar nominated movies, but of course it's still very slow paced and dull(again, as per usual with Oscar nominated movies). It features a lot of long awkward pauses with questions being unanswered. Can't say I really recommend this one, but I've seen worse.
An absolute masterpiece
i could have gave them more 🌟 but this movie need more parts to this movie it was really good but I really hope they make a part 2 to moonlight that's how good this movie is
Such a well done, moving, unpredictable, unformulaic film. Opens windows of enlightenment.
November 27th - 28th 2017
Before you ramble on me hating on this movie. I didn't like this movie, the story was bland and that's it. Does not deserve the oscar.
Probably the best film I've seen this year
Not really sure what to write. I know that everyone was talking about this movie and how great it was but I think it was the subject matter that they enjoyed. I wasn't entertained. The ending was one of the most anticlimactic endings I've endure in awhile
sloww... and  overrated
This will be a film that many simply won't watch, and that is truly a shame because the only way to accept homosexuality is to see it and realize its many stereotypes. This film shows us a more realistic portrayal of a group that has never been featured, and that alone is important.
Too slow and contemplative of life, gave me the idea of talking about nothing through a simple and, at certain point slightly inconceivable, story.
I'm late to seeing this film, but I am so glad that I did. Of everything that I'll say about this film, I want to say that I appreciate this film for portraying very nuanced emotions and not creating a hyper-dramatic piece to shock audiences. When discussing something as sensitive as LGBTQ people of color, I believe it should be handled with care. In the end, Chiron feels like a real human being, not a cinematic one.
All of the performances in this film were wonderful, so wonderful that I could not stop watching once I started.The music and cinematography were both completely on point as well. Once I finished watching, I felt like I had watched the birth, death, and rebirth of a soul. It was so true to someone's experience that I felt physically heavy throughout the film. I fully believe anyone seeking an authentic experience should watch this film.
Waste of time. I don't understand the awards this movie received.
This is one hell of a great movie. I am sure most people have at least a idea of what the film is about. But anyway here is what I knew. Moonlight is a film about a man from the streets of Miami FL. The man is a gay nan and the story, his story in three parts of his life. When he was a boy, when he was a teen, and when hes a grow  man somewhere between the age of 20-30. That is all I knew and I dont think gives away anything. The acting is just superb. Honestly I dont see how this movie could be any better
Really enjoyed the movie , it had a deep underlying message, overall everyone needs love no matter skin, color nor gender .
Super over hyped and absolutely 100% predictable. The amount of greased pockets at the Academy to award this trash as best picture could have fried a mountain of French Fries the size of Mount Everest.
Psst. Has the hype dropped away yet? Okay, good. Such an overrated movie. It's good, but not that good.
Moonlight: Expertly crafting one man's story to dramatic use. Using style and form often overlooked by cinema into a brillant and effective drama flick, one that benifits from its style, form and direction.
A movie which really moves you! So many emotions! Great actors!
Story of lifetime, a story for "your" life. Even though I am not a male and gay, I can relate my life to that of little-Chiron-black.
Standout performances, great script, great direction. Never thought I'd see a movie with such an indie feel win a Best Picture Oscar. Hollywood, take a bow.
Builds up an entire history of love, then suddenly ends.
I knew next to nothing about this movie, I knew it was about a young man coming into his own but I did not know any other details. This is such a beautiful, heartbreaking story that I did not expect. It left me bawling like a baby, great film, so much left unsaid and so much not explained but told so perfectly. Don't miss this one.
Everything about this film is excellent. A special shoutout to Andre Holland, who did not get enough love come awards season.
The camera and music in this film make it breathtaking.  I hope that this is the new Hollywood-- although the story is incredibly difficult to watch.
Not what I was expecting, structurally the film is well made, with a tender, emotional side that only hit me right at the end.
The beauty of Moonlight comes from the cultivation of drama that rises above mere event tragedy. The film operates on an intensely personal level, developing visually rather than audibly, and provides a deeply satisfying conclusion. Though the subject is so deeply niche, Moonlight is a story of relationships, and one in particular that touches the viewers heart.
It's simply not right that I wanted more of this movie.  The 1st and 2nd acts of this movie promise something that could be so profound, earth shattering and revolutionary.  But it goes small in the 3rd act, becoming timid and ponderous.  We see the destination of Chiron.  But the movie shorthands the journey and romanticizes the ending.  That said, I fucking loved it.
Moonlight is the story of young black child's struggle to find himself in a hard and unaccepting world. This film took me by surprise, it is a brilliantly subtle, realistic and heartfelt depiction of a young man's struggle with his own sexuality and how the world around him effects his identity. The script and the acting is so realistic that it often feels like you've stepped into someone's else's shoes and are watching a real life happening in front of your eyes rather than a film. The film is broken into 3 chapters, Little, Chiron and Black and the 3 actors who portray Chiron, Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes are all fantastic, portraying an inner struggle that's just bubbling underneath the surface. Naomie Harris is also excellent as Paula, Chiron's drug addicted mother, showing a great progression in her character as her addiction gets worse.. The film is also beautifully shot and paced with an excellent soundtrack that elevates the story and gives the whole film a quiet grace. Although the narrative itself isn't the most original, it is a beautiful film that tells it's story in very emotional and effective way.
Intelligent well constructed film, that is though provoking and emotionally tense. All concerned give of their best with script, direction and an emotive sound track adding weight to an interesting story. My sympathy for the main character was undermined by his poor life choices leaving me less involved with the film than I expected or perhaps that was the point all along...well worth the effort!
Crap! Absolute crap!
IMHO, Moonlight is another 2016 movie which is overrated (besides Manchester by the Sea of course). Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, but it wasn't that great. Maybe just maybe, because it is capturing the social issue of a true minority (black and gay), so it has everybody attention

As for the performance, the one that shines in this movie IMHO is Thandie Newton alone. While for Mahershala Ali's won at the oscar? Well, it just a good performance in the right movie, not the one that will blown you away like Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, Christopher Plummer in Beginners, or J.K. Simmons in Whiplash.

Overall, it was a good movie about the journey of life (divided into 3 chapter : kid, teen, and adult). However I still enjoy Boyhood very much in the category of a movie about a kid growing up
perfect scenes and very genuine interpretation of a life experience that I may never understand. Beautiful
A joy for the eyes, a subtle and enchanting cinematic spectacle that speaks somehow the truth for so many people out there who face the worst face of life everyday. It is a moving and neatly executed romance, a fantastic breath of fresh air and simultaneously a predictable one. But it is indeed a worthy oscar winner and for sure the best movie of 2016.
5/5.  An excellent film that has fantastic acting all around, an investing story, and some of the most tense scenes I have ever seen on film.
"Moonlight' was easily one of the slowest most un thought provoking Films of the year. But in saying this "Moonlight" did have some nice character moments, especially in the first half. The Plot to "Moonlight" is A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighbourhood of Miami. 

The Direction by "Barry Jenkins" I found to be very choppy at times by having no idea what he wanted to do with what he had. I could tell by watching the film (especially in the second half) that he didn't know how to show these characters as being likeable, had no idea how to skip time periods and didn't know what to put in the final cut of the film and what not to put in. Which brings me onto the editing. The editing in this film I found super hard to keep up with and is one of the main reasons there where so many plot holes. The Acting in this I found to be really good, one of the only great things about this film in my opinion. The main standouts for me where "Mahershala Ali" and "Janelle Monáe". Even though these two actors had minimal time on screen they made the most of their screen time and where super believable. The Characters in this film where all over the place. The main protagonist being Alex who you see grow on screen. This character I found to be very annoying at times and then slightly likeable at other times. The character that I thought was the most believable and likable was Teresa, this is mainly caused by "Janelle Monáe" doing a great job in her role but the screenplay also helped as well. Speaking of the screenplay, I found it to be atrociously written at many points. With some major plot holes and not knowing what happened to many characters one main example being Juan. 

The Score composed by "Nicholas Britell" was exceptionally composed and worked perfectly with the film. One of the biggest issues I had with "Moonlight" was the pacing. The pacing had huge issues with it being way too slow in the second half. I'm majorly surprised I made it through the whole film. The first half of the film had an okay, it was still slow at times but it was watchable. But once it got into the third act, the film just put on its brakes and went to a full on halt. Although one scene I did like from the film was when the main protagonist Alex was with a supporting character Juan at a beach and Juan was teaching Alex to swim. I found that scene to have a big impact on the character and moved the story along well. 

Overall I found "Moonlight" to have some good character moments, excellent acting from two supporting roles "Mahershala Ali" and "Janelle Monáe", and an excellent score that went perfectly with the film. Although it did have major issues with the pacing in the second half, chopping directing, a few annoying characters, a screenplay that was horribly written and horrific editing. I give 2016's "Moonlight" a 3.5/10.
Not sure what all the hype was about. Predictable and slow. Poor acting
To be young, black, poor, and gay is a serious predicament in the USA.  Barry Jenkins' film shows, in three acts with three actors, one man's development, growing from a bullied young boy to an awkward uncertain youth, to a strong and silent man.  His crack-addicted mother (Naomie Harris) casts a huge shadow over everything, adding more difficulties, although for the context (Liberty City, Miami), this may reflect some sad sort of normal.  Even his caring and altruistic self-appointed mentor (played charismatically by Mahershala Ali) is also a drug-dealer.  So, although alienation is the order of the day, real human intervention has lasting effects; sensitive and caring moments, sensitively portrayed, help Little/Chiron/Black to navigate the troubled world, perhaps like beacons of light in the darkness.  The film itself looks beautiful (with black skin looking blue in the moonlight, a poetic phrase that is the source of the title) and there are numerous arthouse moves that reveal the film's goals to be more aesthetic than your typical narrative feature.  Yes, there are autobiographical notes here for Jenkins (extending also from Tarell Alvin McCraney's play) but this is not your usual Oscar-winning biopic - it is something deeper, more personal, touching and affecting, human and heartbreaking.
Ni remotamente tan interesante como la Academia te la quiere vender, para quienes vivimos fuera del mundo norteamericano, "Moonlight" carece de mucho. Articulada en base a 3 momentos en la vida de un joven afroamericano y homosexual que vive en carne propia todo tipo de discriminaciones, el discurso impidió que la película fuese evaluada conforme a su mérito. Porque reconozcámoslo, para nadie pudo haber sido mejor película del 2016. Aún así, deben verla.
This movie is so fucking horrible! So boring! No emotion! No fun! No meaning! 1/10
???, ??? ??? ???????! :-}
A brilliantly realized character study of a young man whose existence is questioned and his sexuality repressed by the environment he comes from.  Kevin is a boy who grows up to a crack addicted mother (Naomie Harris) and spends much of his childhood with her drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) and his motherly girlfriend (Janelle Monae).  Fast forward to his teenage years and we see a very candid kiss between Kevin and his friend Chiron.  The third, and final chapter, shows Kevin in his troubled adulthood searching for answers about what the true meaning of love is.  It's quiet and powerful and so well acted that it flows indelibly.  Truly stirring performances by an unknown ensemble that shows a reflection of how our society views masculinity and femininity in current culture.
A masterwork of filmmaking, but lacks the basic entertainment value that viewers look for in a film. Stunning camera work, acting, and editing. Left me wanting more, however.
How this movie almost lost Best Picture to La La Land is beyond me.
So much hype. Sure those lives are too rarely seen in cinema, but widely seen on the streets, and that's enough.
Considering this movie takes place over the span of like, twenty years, you'd think that at least one or two things would happen in it.
I finally got around to watching this. A slow, beautiful, subtle and understated coming of age film. Certainly deserved the Oscar win. Superb performances and excellent camera work.
I probably didn't like this movie as much because I watched it with my Grandparents and the gay sex scene made it super awkward.
Boring. Felt like a great 30 minute documentary that was dragged out to 2 hours.
A Hollywood favorite for all the suspected reasons.

Skip it Middle America
fucken sweet ass movie
12/8/17 How did this win the best picture? It didn't even have a storyline. This kid is born in thr hood to a drug addicted mother, gets brought up by a drug baron, and as a side note is gay. Not good
Either I haven't seen anything like it, or this piece its truly one of a kind. Amazing colors and acting. Solid way to tell a story. A few of the shots do feel a little bit staged but are executed in a beautiful way that you might not care. If you don't like analyzing anything just skip this movie.
What? there must be something I do not understand about this movie. Maybe I should watch it again.
In my opinion this move is so slow and boring. Very overrated. Naomi performance is still great. I can't understand why this film won the Oscar instead of La La Land.
A movie that panders to the mainstream audience by dealing with the predictable issues of sexuality, poverty, and race. Nothing in this film is remotely revolutionary in any sense of the word. Instead of weaving a subtle, yet genius story-line with several great opportunities for stunning  plot-twists, the movie tells a generic story about a homosexual African American man that feels tailored to this generation of viewers.
Worthy drama but due to the pacing and ambiguous script didn't merit the time invested. I was amazed by the critical reaction and can only assume this was down to the subject matter, which in itself seems a bit patronizing. Acting was earnest but overall a real disappointment due to the silly hype.
Worried about more "Black' lash, Hollywood gave this an award. It doesn't matter no one saw it anyway.
The movie was slow and boring.  To think this could have won best pic of the year is utterly amazing!  It is different, I'll give it that, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
Not the best picture about the topic, but a really good one.
Well worth the watch! Beautiful shot and a pretty interesting story. The actor playing Juan is incredible. I am a little suspicious of the Best Picture win.
Really just the best movie ever. I cried through the entire thing. The way the camera treated the black male body, the careful and profoundly non-manipulative way the story wove around the mother, the tender love between the men. Absolutely perfect.
This movie is clearly the lowest budget of all the Best Picture nominees, and has the least narrative structure as well.  Not that that's a bad thing, it's just different.  Rather than tell a defined story, the film is broken up into three segments, each one a snapshot of different points of a single character's life.  The first two are fantastic, the third... well, not so much.  That third act was SOOO SLOOOOW, it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.  The movie still packs a solid emotional punch, thanks to the first two acts.  This is an important movie, if nothing other than the fact that I think this is the only movie I have ever seen where the main character is a black gay guy. Even so, the themes are universal that anyone can relate to.  This is a poignant film with a lot to say, even though it doesn't come right out and tell you.   You feel it rather than hear it.
I thought this movie was incredibly boring. It was difficult to get through entirely without turning the movie off. The underlying plot was very realistic and touching, but the movie itself was, in my opinion very boring. Then again good movies are few and far between these days.
Barry Jenkins creates an emotional drama that forces you to look its protagonist eye-to-eye and connect with him on an intimate level no matter what your politics might be.
Real raw emotion, well shot. Powerful through ugly and beautiful moments of one man's story.
Moonlight tells the story of a young, gay man as he goes through life. The first act depicts his childhood, the second are his teenage years and the third is him as a grown man in present day. It is a brutally honest depiction of the LGBT struggle, especially for a young black man growing up in a largely conservative community effected by drugs and poverty. The subject matter is heavy, but it opens up a conservation that we NEED to have. Despite these very sad themes, there is a great deal of heart to Moonlight. It's hard to describe without spoilers but trust me it is there. Lastly I also want to point out that for those of you who are familiar with the work of Kendrick Lamar (specifically To Pimp a Butterfly) you'll notice artistic inspirations that Kendrick and Moonlight share. The first song heard in Moonlight is "Every Nigga is a Star" by Boris Gardiner, one of the main characters is listening to the song on his radio in the opening scene. In the first song of TPAB, "Wesley's Theory" the same piece is sampled at the very beginning of the song, its the first sound you hear when you listen to the album. There are other small details that both works share. Needless to say great minds think alike. The original soundtrack for Moonlight is especially powerful. Normally I'm not a fan of classical soundtracks in films (it's a little overdone) but Moonlight's classical OST is so uniquely well done that I would be idiotic not to make an exception. Cinematography is stylized and strong. Iconic scenes, beautiful colors and lighting make for sophisticated and detailed cinematography that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly symbolic. 

Truly a legendary film
Slow-moving, boring and pointless. Just because a  movie aspires to show lives too rarely seen in cinema does not mean it succeeds. Also, the acting is terrible.
Not worth all the fuss.  Gets quite boring near the end.
Great storytelling, execution but I'm not sure it deserves the Oscar
Moonlight is a film that is a piece of cinematic masterclass. The perromences of Mahershala Ali and Ashton Sanders set the movie from the get go to be a gripping, enticing and real portrayal of life as a young African american finding his way through childhood and adulthood in a ghetto. The character construction of Kevin and Juan are pivotal to the films success as these set the beginning and end to what would be Barry Jenkins idea of the Circle of Life in America right now. Kevin we see grow up and struggle to find his identity due conflicting issues with his mother, himself, and society.  This plays a key role in the plot depth and this is the backbone of the film, this alone certifies it as a respectable film. However, the open endness of Moonlight and social commentary it attaches itself too is what makes the film stand out. With the transformation of Kevin ending with him finally accepting who hes is, the audience leaves the theater with a sense of happiness yet overwhelming heartbreak as the Kevin has subsequently become a product of his environment forming into a eerily similar character to Juan. The films little dialogue and excellent cinematography, the audience is left alone with themselves often, which i believe was an asset to the films message. The film is multi layered with a breadth of masterclass performances, even from Barry Jenkins.
Destacada direcciòn, cinematografìa y uso de los colores.
Moonlight is a piece of unsettling yet depressing coming-of-age complex drama. Its complexity then affects the character. It rather makes this film quite heavy. On the other hand, it has memorable dialogues. The impression, of course, is so terrifying. There is a feeling of fear and pity. So your feelings crushed. However, It's about society. This is a breaking-the-rules movie. It's about masculinity, blacks stereotypical, sexuality, and self-awareness. Moonlight becomes a piece of cinema with a strong impact and inspiration. All the performances from the actors are surreal. They all unpredictably. It's just a masterfully-crafted. This is a masterpiece of cinema.
Moonlight doesn't miss a beat. Amazing direction, characters, arcs, style, realism, and everything else a movie can possibly offer. It's a perfect film.
Beautiful cinematography and touching story.
Moonlight is a beautiful drama film which shows the outstanding capabilities of black people in the film industry while also shining a positive light on the otherwise controversial LGBTQI+ community. This film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and it totally deserves it! This type of film is rarely seen in cinema which is a shame but it was refreshing to watch after all these films coming out which are just cliché. Moonlight, go watch it if you haven't already.
It was a good movie. It had unnecessary, slow paced scenes but other than that the story was good. There are three Acts/Phases for the protagonist. You witness the highlight of Chiron's life from when he's a kid, a teenager, and then adulthood. What I'm baffled as to why this movie passed up as the best motion picture when there were scenes that had nothing to do about Chiron's life or anything that would pertain the story itself. While the cinematography, the acting, and of course the development of the story according to Chiron, it was all done so well. Especially portraying the bullying and with one's personal struggle throughout life. While the interpretation is well made, Chrion's interactions with other characters were quite limited. It would have been nice if there were more scenes between them and Chiron, so they're more portrayed than they already are. Don't get me wrong, this movie really is well done and so if anyone's curious to pick this up then go for it. It really is the best motion picture drama of 2016.
A compassionate rumination on race, sexuality and identity, speaking for voices rarely heard in cinema.
I felt it disconnected in some parts and with a lack of history, but i's a nice "documentary"
This love movie is amazing !!!
You gonna cry
the first chapter was good Mahershala was great. Second chapter I cheered when he broke that chair. Third chapter that was a delicious looking Palomilla steak. started off good but  it didn't hold my interest to the end.
so nicely filmed but the plot was a little monotonous.
Emotional. Profound. Powerful. Remarkable. 
Simply one of the best coming of age films in forever.
Movie night with Iris. 

This is groundbreaking, earnest filmmaking. It is beautifully shot, and I really wanted to love this. The first third is superb, every plaudit deserved. The sea baptism scene, and score are simply epic. However I just didn't resonate with parts two and three. I've seen better in The Wire, and felt it started to drag.

For me and Oscars '17 Lion is the better film. Although I do feel I will revisit this one, to see if I'm wrong.
An excellent first two acts are marred a bit by the somewhat underwhelming third, Moonlight is still a fantastic film with incredible performances, especially from child actor Alex Hibbert.
A brilliant film with regards to acting, writing and cinematography, I just felt it lacked the traditional plot I've become accustomed to.
gran pelicula ver su vida es alucinante  un adolecente negro con una madre drogadicta y que fue criado por un vendedor de drogas
A movie that represents problems with people and there life dealing with these problems. The story is compelling and makes the audience fight for the main characters. Relatable moments in our own lives is what drives the eagerness from the audience. Sexuality and differences are a huge deal and the way Barry Jenkins wrote it in regards to  a young kid struggling all the way up to adult hood is breathtaking as this movie is very realistic.
Sensitive and powerful.
What an overrated garbage film. I'm not racist. I can respect a good film. Dope was an academy award winning film next to this "heart wrenching epic"... HAH. I almost fell asleep twice and I was on an airplane with nowhere else to go and nothing else to do and it still couldn't keep my attention. I'm pretty well read, but this was not worthy of an academy nod let alone best film!!!! Now, I will suggest that the build up and high expectation of watching this after winning best film could have influenced my opinion but it was pretty awful.  Best of luck watching.
Good watch - masterclass in acting, filmmaking and storytelling.  Not one I think I'll keep going back too but like an Ed Sheeran song I admire its many qualities
Come for the cinematography and acting, leave in the middle for lack of dialogue, story and action.  This one is VERY slow.
Flawlessly crafted and well-deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. It takes conventional standards for the underdog movie or hood movie and makes a touching, emotional, and painfully real film.
With its grounded story brought to life through skilled and inspired hands, "Moonlight" is a notable achievement in small scale film making.
"Who is you?" sums up the man's silent struggle. Moonlight is a remarkable piece of film making and acting!
An unusual coming of age film. Bit of a slow-burner, but a distinctive take on black masculinity and the pressures of being true to yourself.
(Best Picture Winner at 2016 Oscars)

After the Oscar flub, I was kinda chapped that this film actually beat La La Land, my favorite film of 2016 at Best Picture. After that messup, I chose to check this film out to see what the Critics were getting at with it's phenomenal reviews. Those reviews including Chris Stuckmann's (My Favorite Movie Reviewer) A+ Review. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It was a kind of film that I haven't seen before, a film looking at a man's life through three stages; Child, Teen, and Adult while he struggles with the truth that he has bisexual feelings for his best friend. This film was beautiful Writing wise and Cinematography wise. This film had an excellent script accompanied by beautiful unique shots. Props to writer/director Barry Jenkins for making a visual masterpiece. The acting was excellent also. Mahershala Ali deserved that Best Supporting Actor Award, He was amazing in this film. The three guys playing Chiron did excellent portraying a guy trying to figure out where his life is going and his feelings for other characters. Ashton Sanders in my opinion was the best portrayal as the Teenage Chiron in high school figuring out himself. Naomie Harris did well as an addict mom who figures out in the end that she was a bad parent and that she actually loved her son. Janelle Monáe also did excellent as the mother figure that Chiron always wanted. The score was an excellent fit for the film. The tracks fit the scenes so perfectly. Overall, I'm not chapped that this film beat out La La Land for Best Picture because this film is a very excellent runnerup against La La Land. It was an excellent film visually and story telling wise. An Excellent Watch! Would have definitely been in my top 10 of 2016 if I had seen it before the year ended.


Rating: 9.5/10
Punishingly boring and too familiar, Moonlight is a severely overhyped film.
Gritty? Yes. Hard to watch? Yes. Emotionally driven? Yes? Overrated? Absolutely. Good film it is, Oscar winner - no.
This is a gut-wrenching story about identity that constantly leaves room for the audience to sink into Chrion's state of mind.
Has everything, except a plot. That would be fine if the film was only 30 minutes long.
Great cinematography, acting & music. However story didn't really draw me in...slow story.
As undeserving of an Academy award as Trump is of the presidency.
This movie was a bit over-hyped, and I was expecting it to be spectacular, whereas I just found it very good. A great look into the social difficulty of men relating to one another, even beyond the further unique struggles of growing up gay in the hood.
A Best Picture winner that I... agree with?!
One of the most bored movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Boring, dull and predictable theme
Moonlight is an artistic and fascinating movie that will stick with you. However, I feel alone in thinking Chiron in the final act was unconvincing. I pictured him growing up to be more fabulous. Still, quality original movie overall.
A good movie but wasnt great. I watched it because of the awards it had one but was left scratching my head confused as to how it did so well. It was good but not a life changing movie like the celebrities on TV have made it out to be.
As the 2017 oscar winner for best picture, I was expecting something marvoulous. I was so disappointed when I watched it. The few powerful moments are drown in a slow direction, nothing happens in 75% of the movie. the dramatic topics are not exploited enough.
Best movie I've seen in a while. Don't have one bad thing to say about it.
The most forgetfully memorable Oscar Winner ever.
Not really a fan of character study movies because they usually just end.  The first section of this movie when he is a boy was by far the best part, then it got less interesting as it went on.
Finally got to see "Moonlight" on Blu ray, because we don't get a lot of Indy films in my little town. I heard a lot of Buzz about this movie and saw that it won a lot of awards, so naturally I was really wanting to see this one in the worst kind of way. I must say, it is beautifully shot, and artfully directed. The cast was great. All of the performance were tremendous. The standout for me, by far, was Naomie Harris as the mother of Chiron. I did feel the emotions that the characters were feeling and Mr. Jenkins does a great job keeping you invested in the film. With all that now being said, this movie is way overhyped. Yes the movie is acted and directed well but the actual story did not do a lot for me. Also there were aspects of the film that seemed out of place and definitely this is not a film for everyone. If you love it that is great and I understand but I do not see best picture o0f the year here.
Between 2.5 and 3 (but the last half star is just by the issue it talks about). Yes, it is good that they make movies about vulnerable colectivities. Yes, the movie has some moments in which you feel sympathy about people who suffers. However, you always have the feeling that the movie moves alongs pathways you have already seen, or you can imagine about. To be Best Picture-Academy Prize winner, not much powerful, but in certain moments.
There is a sparcity of words and action that I find unbearable...I couldn't make it through the whole thing. Also I just didn't see the gayness about him that everyone in the film seemed to see and ridiculed him for especially when he was very little. His mom said he walked in a  certain way, I just didn't see that. As a result all the movie did is frustrate me.
At Its Core, An Insubordinate Drama Where Transcends Racial Hate & Homophobia

Apparently, American film colossus learned from the popular debacles of the past, now it starts a thorough inquiry in order to unveil stories implicating everything and everyone. Just a year ago, totalitarian society was embedded in the protests, led by movie personalities of color, for the small amount of participation of any-non-English-speaking actor or filmmaker in different annual film festivals, emphasizing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Months later, either objectively or subjectively, the more than 1,000 Academy members have nominated a heterogeneous movie range, in which ethnicity is preeminent, striving for the most significant awards of the evening: "Best Motion Picture" and "Best Director" ("Moonlight" or "Fences"). One of the most eloquent contenders is Barry Jenkins' neo-creation, if we interpret it in a superficial way, illustrates three formative periods in correlative gradation of a gay black male, however, scrutinizing it from the inside out, we notice a limpid treatment about a little-known environment by huge studios, one where poverty, loneliness, orphanhood, violence, drug abuse, and intolerance ravage to any boy residing by such degrading places. Not necessarily you must be African-American or gay to converge your own existential opinions with Chiron's, this is because it's defined as a universal tale both in effect and purpose; an important epic supported by the reality, using to aesthetic and melodic lyricism to remind the spectator a truism that is being ignored to collective will, something doesn't require a harmless seasoned to cover its importance, rough beauty and ordinary human need within a quasi-two-hour motion picture.

It begins with a circular tracking shot to place the audience into the perverse place where the main character will have to grow up, an atmosphere which breaths dioxide formed by the miasma of bullets, prostitution, vices, scams, sex, narcotics and death. The films encompassing African-American marginalized populations tends to implement certain hallmarks produced by social disruption, which is caused by deficiencies (social exclusion, police brutality or  educational neglect) leading an unsuspected doctrinal starting point. Jenkins, who's devoted to these "stereotypes" of films about black race, delineates naturally a Miami punished by the sun, space where Chiron's hilarities, notions, dreams, disappointments, learnings, decisions, and fluids that go from scarlet blood or saline sobs to the experimental sperm were fixed to torrid precarious ground of American ghettos, experiences richly raised through three temporary gradations (childhood, youth and adulthood) marked by three irrefutable denotations of the character in question  (Little, Chiron, and Black).

"You can be gay, but you don't have to let nobody call you a faggot"

Narratively, it can be compared with dense, epic and fatiguing Richard Linklater's "Boyhood", "Moonlight" employs narrative in sections as standalone episodes comprising altogether an intense realism, an initiative bracing the trip and psychic and emotional spurs of the characters. The whole product is much more than the sum of its parts. It expels conviction, transformation and freedom of all kinds; It's something that concerns you and gets under your skin beyond the closing credits. Fractional exposition allows more intimate contact with what happens to Little, young or mature man; each chapter works as an independent installment, splendidly played by an ardent diverse cast, photography as real as visceral, a soundtrack combines emotional position of a given moment and a series of components employs simplicity and truthfulness as info carrier. It entails entirely the kind of film which is imperative for us more than ever, one that talks about what can happen a common human being and grows apart itself from the oneiric. It's patent the limited trust around nobility of our existence to conceive art, we make other worlds rather than appealing infinity of opportunities are around us.  

The visuals are marvelous, repel the tendency of those recurring feature films using desaturation and dreadmist to portray real-life occurrences. Here,  fluorescent bright colors come together dark contrast in order to animate and give a distinct personality to each planned segment, mise-en-scène intensifies its fantastic beauty with precise camera movements at the hands of skilled James Laxton. Music, light and camera aesthetically shape the movie, equipping with sensitivity and depth Chiron's life, while simultaneously, it reduces the inherent hostility of the American atmosphere. Visual and writing screenplay combined with tremendous credibility, while John (one of the most humane performances of a drug dealer in the cinema history by California native Mahershala Ali) recites to Chiron the origin of his nickname (Blue), the story applies optionally sparkling moonlight involvement in the last scene, in which he invites us to do the same he did, to try to define us, not to fear, to be who want to be, to develop a global principle entrusted to humanity; living in freedom.

Barry Jenkins' "Moonlight" officially starts the participation of two of the social groups more unjustly repudiated by contemporary society: black race and homosexuals. Each person can draw deductions, opinions and criticisms, but the truth is that what these men and women-dedicated to cause a change-have made is a fearless and decisive social and filmic feat, which's realized by universal subjects such as youth, rashness, self-improvement, love, masculinity, and life. "Moonlight" is a grade-A drama, literally powerful, visually linked to the truth; its power doesn't come from complex intelligible narrative tricks, the charm lies in connection with the characters and the unintentional identification with coexistence human nature: acceptance (tolerance).
Amazing picture. I never knew I wanted it but here it is. Just go watch it.
Moonlight possesses both, a powerful direction and adequate performances, along certain strong emotional moments, but the story never reaches any deep corners and its conclusion is neither clear nor bigger to compare it with the rest of the film.
Amazing movie worth every bit of the hype
Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, Moonlight brilliantly captures the diverse nature of a culture too rarely seen in motion pictures.
The cinematography alone is worth the watch. Great job.
A film that is set during the War of Drug era that explores the life of an African-american male copping with his sexuality. A simple idea that gets elevated into something remarkable! Moonlight was slow, but beautiful. Emotional, yet powerful.
I didn't take much from this movie initially, in part due to the hype this movie has received. I expected more, which is unfair to a movie that so clearly made every choice intentionally and told the exact story it intended to. Quality film.
Hollywood loves films that touch on LGBT (I use touch lightly); mix that with a Hood story; throw in some protests; some trump and you got yourself an Academy film and supporting actor winner.
It's Miami By the Sea. So I'm giving it the same rating.
It is not surprising how the critical notes and the normal users are different moonllight is a film difficult to understand often with a heavy tone even for a drama in this type, and it is very gratifying to see the evolution of chiron during the 3 acts Of the film all three actors that interprets it are many good, carry with themselves the weight and the motivations of the character but they are never equal that leaves the special film since the acting until the boy that stars in the first part of the film is phenomenal, The performances in general are perfect the soundtrack composed by classical music is phenomenal and the evolution of the plot is very good, the film shows what it is like to be a man in black society prejudice, homosexuality, and how two people can follow similar paths but a lot Different at the same time, a great deserving of the Oscar who won, note 100
Nope. Just depressing...
although the story kept me watching each chapter wondering what's next......
the movie just ended wirth me going THAT'S IT!?!?!?!?
 
i guess i was looking to see if the bullies got revenge or how they turned out. 

and i guess i was looking for him to try a woman but that didn't happen

So most definitely unpredictable just like i like my movies it just wasn't my type of movie.

i need more action

definitely wouldn't have gotten my vote for the academy awards
If Terrence Malick had directed a Spike Lee script it might well have become Moonlight. It's a wonderfully acted, borderline pretentious drama about a lonely child discovering his sexuality and honouring the human need for love. Barry Jenkins allows his cast to mumble inaudibly, which is occasionally frustrating, but it's an unusual and often very beautiful film with a great soundtrack.
Dealt with very real, very relevant challenges in the hood. The suffering is real. Eyeballs sweating at the end.
Terrific movie! Moonlight lives up to all the hype.
Sensitive story telling but Oscar worthy?
The first half of the movie is very good, then the final act is just an underwhelming conversation that leads to a poor attempt at a non ending.
Watching the first two acts, I could understand what all the buzz was about, but the third act was a snoozer for me. A good film, but not Oscar worthy.
A bit joyless in a Brokeback Mountain kind of way. But I guess that's the whole point.
This movie looks like it cost 10x more than it did. The performances and craft are pretty revelatory. Biggest surprise: a spot-on classical soundtrack.
I'm not sure if I saw the best picture of the year.  While it was a good character driven story about a black, soft spoken, homosexual from a tough uprising, I prefer some of the other nominated pictures.    Slow pacing
glowing, raw and beautiful
Absolute Garbage. Saw 10 people leave the cinema during the beach scene. LMAO
Barry Jenkins finds a masterpiece in Moonlight, a drama with fulfilled potential of great proportions. It's well acted, emotionally gut-wrenching and it provides an insightful look at lives that the film industry doesn't focus on too often.
Even though this movie didn't really have a plot, it just was, it was an interesting look at something many people may have never thought about.
A strong, coming-of-age narrative, bringing to the forefront the undiscussed subject of a gay black boy's sexuality.
I don't knew where the best part of this film who make 80% people like this.
Amazing acting with a depth that pulls you in.
Holy sh1t! Can't remember feeling this raw watching a movie in the last decade. Very difficult and emotionally tangling story with very little satisfaction of any kind throughout the film. It keeps on giving. It's a pretty horrendous experience and life of a young adult told in 3 stages of his life. Ultimately It is not meant to prove anything.
So touched, impressed. Making people think more after when the boy bathed under the moonlight.
Here's the rub- Moonlight is beautifully filmed, acted, directed and the narrative split into three acts is both seemless and elegant. I also liked Naomie Harris (in a largely over-looked performance) as the negligent crack- addict mum. The only thing that fell a bit short was Chyrone's teenage homosexual tryst with a school friend. I didn't feel that this brief encounter of lust would have captivated him on a romantic level (especially after the same 'friend' pummels him in the school yard to impress his peers). Is Chyrone suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Is this the only man he's romantically attracted to? Someone who shares a joint and jerks him off, then repeatedly gay bashes him? Oh well, each to his own. Good film anyway
"Moonlight" is a beautifully filmed drama with powerful acting performances and deep direction that manages to capture genuine emotion and convey complex themes by showcasing a story of African-American lives that are usually not shown in cinemas.
It's depressing from the start to the finish, and I just don't see any significantly important point to the movie. Had to also read the plot of the movie to know exactly what is going on.
This is what happens when someone pushes too hard the barriers of the politically correct.
Though decently crafted with moving moments, Moonlight is not as new, telling, or compelling as it thinks it is.
This is a must watch I keep believe how amazing this movie is. Every scene stuck out to me everything felt so real. The main character I felt so attached so fast this is an amazing movie story that everyone should give a chance.
It's strangely crafted with similar drama as one would find in a college feminist's story about the struggle of being a woman.  That's not to dismiss that there is a real struggle that comes with being a woman, and likewise with being Black and gay, but the problem is that it relies too heavily on the sympathy of the audience to create their own engagement with the film solely on the fact that the main character has such struggles.  A film can't simply have that most bare skeleton of a plot and be good.  There has to be good characters, good acting, and nuance, and with all that together creates the engagement/intrigue.  Sadly this film has none of that and opts to stay relatively flat and empty throughout, minus the bare minimum conflict that there actually was (which the film chooses not to follow even though it was the most interesting part).  All in all, pretty dull.
I thought the story line was weak, and the dramatic change the main character goes through from Act 2 to 3 verges on the absurd and unbelievable. Mahershala Ali was crazy good and its message rang through sound and clear, but the movie overall was a let down (especially after seeing Moonlight embarrass all of La La Land because of the Best Picture fiasco).
Better than all the nominees I've seen so far except Manchester by the Sea and Hell or High Water
It was just a standard gay drama, how did they give the Oscar to this movie, it amazes me. Maybe I didn't understand everything or maybe I'm right and it's just a good Sunday TV movie.
Moonlight is artistic and achingly human; full of great performances, great direction and a thematic aesthetic. I love this movie and I would highly recommend it!
I think this is one of the worst movies ever
A good but overrated film. It's controversial nature gets it a good additional star from people that just want to show how cool they are.
Storyline is well developed and keeps the audience's interest. Felt that there should have been more to the movie but the message in the film is vivid. Would definitely recommend but perhaps not for a second time around. Overall, great acting, great storyline, and great vibe.
Moonlight is one of those movies that's so important, you need to see it at least once in your life. The mother addicted to drugs feels all too real and relatable for me, and its message is very well realized.

10/10
Ponderous story about growing up black, ridden with clichés like drug dealers, crack whores and prison. The only wrinkle is the kid is gay, and that mostly seems to serve for a lot of heavy, meaning-laden looks. Bleh.
This year's Best Picture at the Oscars. Based on the memories growing up in Miami's Liberty City, Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney tell a stunningly soulful and heartachingly intimate coming-of-age narrative about an African-American young man's gruelling throes to keep up with the expectations of black masculinity and to stay true to his identity.
This was so goddamn beautiful. Not just visually but also performance and story wise as well. This is definitely not your average african american gangster film.
One unfortunately miscast and misscripted film.  All is believable until
Chiron grows up.  Parts 1 and 2 are great but the massive belly flop of part 3 extinguishes the votive candles  lit up till then.   What's happened to the dream deferred, the promise of this film? 
I mean, do you really think a tough guy dealer couldn't manage to find a sexual partner of some sort in all those years?   So this script manages to perpetuate the myth of gay male passivity.  
The writer didn't really know where to go with the script in Part 3.  His decision traps the movie in the very homophobia, in-the-closetness that it purports to denounce.  It's a movie that stays deep in the closet.  No pride here.  On the down low from A to Z which is pretty sad but just right for Hollywood. Casting Trevante Rhodes in the role of the adult Chiron is the central error of this film, no longer a sensitive thoughtful man but now a smug, narcissistic, muscle clad hunk who no doubt spends every leisure moment lifting weights. He does not manage to project a conflicted personality.  No edginess.  From Chris Rock to The Rock physically.  The character's transition is simply not credible or emotionally coherent. Perhaps another actor might have pulled it off.  But the choice of Trevante Rhodes cements the fundamental flaw in this script, an emotional disconnect  between the parts so that all young and adult Chiron have in common is their ethnicity. When I told a Black female friend about this movie, she said she didn't want to hear about it it due to its subject.  She is a mother of a young boy.  This brought home to me the pathos and truth of this subject, the heavy, suffocating lid that societies put on same sex sexual attraction.
Divided into three parts where we follow Chiron, known as Little, as he grows up. We follow him as nine, mid-teenager and as a young adult. He lives in a hood filled with drugs and kids treating him bad. He got few friends and he never seem like the happiest of kids, having a addict as a mom. Juan and his girl, portrayed by Janelle Monáe, is one of the few people that's being nice to him. Kevin is his only friend his own age.

The film looks great and the pacing is very nice. The development is certain as he ages and the divided chapters are coming out real smooth. It's a bit to safe, putting the setting and plot to test at all times. Chiron is young, black, bullied and the gay vibes are always in the mix. It's important for the story, but also the only vital things for me.

I liked it, it's well produced and acted out, but not dearing enough to become one of the best films this round of Academy Awards.

7.5 out of 10 fronts.
I know that Moonlight is "The Emperor's New Clothes" of movies, and you're not supposed to say anything bad about it, but the emperor is naked and this movie is terrible. It's a completely pretentious and horribly tedious film in both structure and content. This feels like a student film, only not as enjoyable. The Academy got it wrong -- this should not be a Best Picture winner.
Way overrated, certainly not worth a certified fresh rating.
It was a good film allright ... a little boy from the hood who is gay and bullied in unforgiving hood living with his meth head mother growing up trying to survive BUT I think Manchester by the sea was better film also what was Mahershala Ali's screen time ? 10 minutes ? an Oscar ? for that ? Come on....
Moonlight (Barry Jenkins (III), 2016) - 10/10
It's a real unfolding journey of a boy to a man with bumps and bruises and love in unexpected places along the way!
Not as good as I thought it would be. Very slow. Would've loved to see more of Mahershala Ali.
Moonlight is arguably one of the best films of the year that has a plot that is told by visuals even if the ending can be at first confusing. 100%
Interesting movie, but not great or groundbreaking or even really touching.
Chiron is an African-American child, growing up in Miami.  Neglected by his mother, he is effectively raised by a drug-dealer, Juan, and his girlfriend, Teresa.  Due to his passive ways he is often a target for bullies.  Onto his teenage years and the bullying continues.  All this time he has one true friend - Kevin - and the relationship between Chiron and Kevin ultimately forms the spine of the story.

Good drama about growing up, the relationships we form and how these are carried over into adult life.  More specifically, the experience of a gay African-American child, the issues faced in growing up and how this shapes his life and relationships.

A bit underwhelming though, especially considering that this movie won the 2017 Best Picture Oscar.  The themes don't feel fully formed, leaving the movie feeling not overly profound.  Ending is quite anticlimactic, when it should have been very emotional.

The main problem is that writer-director Barry Jenkins concentrates more on the bigger picture, and fitting as much of Chiron's history into a certain amount of time.  More character and relationship details were needed.  A slower progression was in order - the first two periods of Chiron's life seems rushed and we are just fed the story without having time to contemplate on it.  Not often I say this: the movie needed to be longer, about 30 minutes longer.

This all said, the story is original and engaging.  It is never dull - as mentioned, if anything, it moves too quickly.  It just needed more substance.
Moonlight isn't just your typical LGBT movie (I'd even say the LGBT aspects of the movie are overstated as it also focuses on racism and the harsh living environment the protagonist lives in. There's a reason why it's M18 and not R21.) It is a worthy Oscar Best Picture winner because of the great performances and well-written script. My major issue with the film is that it could've been deeper in the plot (I'd say maybe the last third of the movie when it was more boring; albeit a necessary addition to the movie), especially since the movie is not even 2 hours long.
This is the most boring movie I have ever seen.
A very good and interesting movie! This movie is about a boy growing up in 3 different stages. Kid, Teen, and Adult.
Beautiful movie with simple visuals. Left a lot of questions unanswered but I guess such is the appeal of the film
There is very little to this movie and I was very disappointed in it. Basically a boy grows up. He happens to be gay, at least once, and he barely speaks. That's about it. There is no plot other than boy grows up. It's like that movie of a boy's life a few years ago, really nothing happens except everyone ages. It's also full of stereotypes and cliches. When will movie makers do a movie about a girl growing up? We have two now about boys aging into men, let's see some movies about girls becoming women and all the crap we have to go through just to survive. Moonlight is overrated and very depressing.
Moonlight is quite an interesting one. I wasn't sure what to expect but here is how I felt about the movie.
First of all, let's summarize real quick: Moonlight tells the story of an Afro-American from his childhood to his adulthood. The movie is divided in three acts; each of them shows a part of his life. He lives a hard life with his junkie mom.
This movie is really slow-paced and it kind of goes nowhere. That's what is beautiful about it. The atmosphere around Chiron (main character) is incredibly heavy, awkward. The endless silences, the way he looks at people, everything will make you feel uncomfortable.
The film is also really well made in terms of shooting and the multiple contrasts around the characters made this experience pleasant.
The ending is well thought in my opinion: unpredictable yet simple. It brings up debates and that is very enjoyable.
I recommend this movie but be patient, as I said, it is extremely slow and "nothing" happens during it.
The jewel of the moonlight films
Damn. A rare and excellent observation of humanity. An intimate film you are probably better off watching alone in order to truly allow yourself to connect with Chiron and the world around him. You feel his love, his frustration, his anger, his loneliness. A well rounded and expertly executed production, no other film this year was better qualified to win the Best Picture Oscar.
MY CREAM-OF-THE-CROP CHOICE for 2016: 'MOONLIGHT'
Storytelling, continuity, unpredictability, but the best ingredient ever: the casting. The director chose each of three actors based on their eyes - not their faces. It worked really well. I bathed in this film. It crept under my skin. It ripped my heart out and then placed it back inside my chest but operating just a bit 'better' if you will. Stunning. It really helped that I went into the theater not knowing a thing about the plot - or sub-plot. Like reveling in a good meal with the perfect wine to accompany it, 'Moonlight' just was the best entrée I filled my soul with in the fall of 2016, and it may just be my favorite film ever.
I like what's behind the courtain: the matrix of the story. But I found it flavorless, with a few peaks of shine. Overrated.
except for the fact the fact it's very realistic and well played, very very regular and nothing that will be remembered one hour after seeing it....
A tragic yet inspiring movie. Despite having LGBT element, the development of story, particularly on the way the story is told, is truly soul-stirring.

Slow paced but nevertheless, remarkable!
One of the best films of 2016. "Moonlight" is a very moving and inspiring film. Very Highly Recommended!!
Absolutely riveting.  The film may leave you with a lot of questions, but that's a reflection of real life, isn't it?  The characters are multidimensional and the performances suberb.  I can hardly believe this movie even got made, with the superficial nonsense that we're usually fed at the theatres. Well done!
Moonlight doesn't feel like a scripted film, it feels real - and has a very important story to tell.
Not a bad movie I wouldn't watch it again but not bad
a good drama. good actors. good storyline. believable. best part filmed in 305. Liberty city represented. and at the last respect and love always wins.
Far too slow for my liking ??
Yeah.. whatever Oscar. 
Long pause.
It's good but..
Best Movie of the Year....for real...
A well filmed movie with a lot of deep drama , however it was quite plane for me , his  continous sorrow made me feel  uncomfortable
9.5/10 

The only little flaw I thought was Juan's character, I felt like the film did not explain more of the reason he went from his bad side of town to helping out young Chiron.

Moonlight is about the life of Chiron how he has a life with switches of turning events. Chiron starts as a kid that would get picked on by other kids because of his sexual orientation. His mother is a drug addict and he would try to run away to stay with Juan and Theresa who take very good care of him. From there as a kid, Chiron changes phases of growing up while facing the ordeals he has come across with.

The film display a lot of development of Chiron's character, it has a lot of meaning in separable ways of life while growing up. Chiron has a friend name Kevin who shows mutual feelings for him too. The changes from his boyhood to teenager to adult were displayed very well from the film. This is the finest story and acting that displays connections to friends and families throughout the film.
The soundtrack played smoothly in every part and it calmly transition through scenes. 

Moonlight definitely deserves that Oscar's choice for best film of 2016. It is remarkable how a this film shows all traits from one focused character.

It's a very very sad movie and it remind us that there are unfortunate people that have been dragged into a horrible life, but it doesn't showed us anything more than what we have already learned at school, it's just touchy and when you think more about it, it might even be a little bit racist.
Heartrending and true.
worth the time.... very good!
Empty and boring. I'm honestly offended this won Best Picture at the Oscars.
too fragmented lacking connections so didn't know what happened to father figure/drug dealer in beginning...was he in jail, dead?  Funeral referenced but he was mentioned later in present tense. Skip 10 yrs what happened after fight at school to living in Atlanta? Also, how did mom go from nurse to crack addict. Best pic should be near perfect or at least a best picture...which to me this was not. Ok at best. Gotta give it up for performances which were great.
Beautifully made the direction, editing, dialogue, acting, even the soundtrack are all top notch and work together to tell the story of a boy's life, his journey of becoming a man, and discovering who he is.
This movie won best picture why?  Hell or High Water was much better and more entertaining.
This movie was creepy as hell. Wouldn't recommend.
Why is doing a boring film about some current social issues always seen as brilliant? This is dull. This is like watching a Gus Van Sant film, and not surprisingly it is just as overrated. Just filming a whole bunch of people moping around isn't brilliant.
Boring and waste of time for a straight audience or it just might be only me. I only watched it as it was an Oscar winning movie without knowing about the plot. While it did have good performances I just couldn't connect with the movie.
The restaurant scene, almost all of third part of the movie is really good. The over-hype isn't useful for Moonlight, because it's a very simple and solid film.
This was a phenomenal movie. I have a hard time sitting through most movies once. I watched this 3 times in a row.
I can't think of one other film that delves into male emotions the way Moonlight does. Most films are about men having guns or skills instead of emotions. Moonlight dares to suggest--gasp!--that a man's emotions are a powerful force in shaping his world. That won this film an Oscar.
Que gran película, muy bien actuada, y brutalmente narrada, visualmente es grandiosa y la historia es bella en su simpleza.
This is a story of the Lifetime
This film leaves to many holes, questions, even in the end it leaves you wondering just what is it he seeks.  What is it beyond the trip to visit his friend and experience from the past?
Before I start my review, I have to get this off of my chest...

Now that I've seen this movie, I can officially say without absolute certainty, that I think that La La Land deserved the Academy Award for best picture. Why'd they have to pull a Steve Harvey and break my heart like that?! Ahem. Moving on.

This wasn't a bad film and I actually enjoyed it. But I found it hard to appreciate what the film was trying to say because I personally found it difficult to like Chiron at many points of the film. I understand that his mother was horrible and he was bullied while growing up while living in a harsh environment where being an alpha male is the norm within the suburbs and not to mention the fact that being gay is unacceptable too for most blacks. I get it. But you know something, he had plenty of chances to make something out of his life and he just doesn't.

And despite his hardships, it's not like he didn't have support. Teresa was a far better mother than a lot of people have and Juan despite being a drug dealer. treated him really well too. Speaking of Juan... what the hell happened to him? Did he die? Did he break up with his girlfriend after Chiron found out that he was a drug dealer? Why does the movie somehow forget to mention what happened to the character with the most screen time in the first portion of the film? You'd think they'd at least show a funeral or something. And it's really disappointing because he really won me over with his fantastic response to Chiron's innocent question.

Chiron: "What is a faggot?"
Juan: "It's something people say to make gay people feel bad."

A better answer could not have been said. And then poof! Juan is gone for the rest of the film. Very bizarre that they elected to get rid of their big name actor Mahershala Ali so soon. (He was fantastic in the Marvel Netflix TV Show Luke Cage and I loved him in the 4400 too) But regardless of Juan's mysterious disappearance, he still briefly had a father figure and also had a mother figure he could fall back on as well.

Now what happened in school was bull shit and I do sympathize for him for that. Terrel was a total ass hole. How he manipulated Kevin was so messed up and I can totally understand the psychological damage Chiron got because it came after their sexual encounter. (Speaking of, not to take away from the seriousness of the moment, as a straight male, I think I finally understand what it's like for straight women to watch to Lesbians make love. Very awkward indeed.) But even so, Chiron was a dumbass. In what world does it make sense to go into school the next day and wack a dude that is at least 50 pounds heavier than you with a chair in the back of the head. Even if you don't get into trouble, (hahaha... dumbass) did he really think he could win that fight? The Guidance Counselor was trying to help him out and he IGNORED IT. HE IGNORED IT. Why? Bruh, I'm trying hard to sympathize for you, but when you have the answers to the test being put right in front of you and you deliberately choose to ignore them, I'm sorry but I lose all sympathy and laugh at the consequences of the mistake you just made.

With all of that being said, that third act was phenomenal! If I was rating this movie based off of that alone, it would be a 5/5. We see what has become of Chiron and it is truly depressing. He never gets over his past and therefore never truly embraces himself for who he is. And then we see Kevin. Chiron's childhood friend who was a troublemaker but worked on his own issues and made something out of his own life. We see an awkward exchange between old friends and then a really emotional moment when Chiron finally admits what we knew all along before the ending credits roll up. Really well set-up and it gives the audience hope that Chiron might finally get to live his life without fear of judgment from other people.

Overall, I loved the message of the film and how it was never specifically preached at you but you could still easily figure it out on your own. What I didn't like was how long it took the film to build up and explain itself. Chiron was a good kid and he took a path that was illogical. Yet at the same time, he was rude to Teresa for most of the movie. And while I loved the heartfelt moment he had with his mother, it was terrible that he never granted Teresa that same satisfaction since she actually deserved it. And maybe I missed it, but I don't believe he thanked Teresa once throughout the entire film. After all she and Juan did for him, the least he could do was show her a little appreciation. And again, NO EXPLANATION FOR JUAN'S DISAPPEARANCE?! Come on man!
Did I enjoy La La Land more? Yes. BUT this deserved the W for best picture
Feels like a nice little movie that is well acted and directed. Best movie of the year.....not really.Good but great????
2017 oscar?..
Zorlu bir cocukluk geçiren gay zenci chiron un hikayesi..
Wow Great movie really brings you into the life of the characters you feel every little moment in detail. jus amazing
Loved the movie! It was so well made and the story line was not what I was expecting. Great acting all around!
For me you can't shake the feeling watching this film that it's garnered such acclaim because it's about a young black homosexual.  There's nothing wrong with that obviously, and perhaps that it the film's main importance but it's difficult to then assess the film on it's own feet.  There are certainly sections which are extremely moving, particularly the central story of the 3.  The film though as a whole is a slight affair, the exceptional performances make you care, but it won't live in the memory for me as a cinematic great.
I know it is just me, but I am not interested in depressing movies about people with no character.
Routine indie fare - but the social engineers over at the Academy seemed to like it a lot.
Excelente drama mas não é o meu favorito do Oscar
A very forgettable movie. Put my wife to sleep and she wasn't tired.
If you are aware of film, I'm sure you know this won the best picture of the year.  So obviously it's a really good movie.  It wasn't my personal favorite of the year, but it's definitely in my top ten hands down, probably top five. The acting/ the cast was probably the strongest things about this movie.  Everyone acted very well and everything felt very natural.  None of it felt like acting, which is a great feat.  Mahershala Ali seems to be a really great actor, and I wished I could have seen more of his character.  I'll try to watch some more things with him in it.  I really liked his portrayal of the villain in Luke Cage.  The storytelling in Moonlight was really well done too.  I liked that it was split into three different chapters.  It didn't really have any of the amazing shots that I like to see in my "best picture" films.  Movies like Arrival or The Revenant had such great cinematography, and that's important to me.  All in all, this was a really good movie though.  I think overall, it is a better movie than La La Land, but La La Land is more enjoyable. However, Arrival and Deadpool are still my top two of the 2016 year.
Incredible story. No glitz, no glam, just the nitty gritty of it all. Incredibly strong cast!
I had to go back and watch this film a second time.  The first time I was upset and how miserable, neglected and lonely a child can be with a drug-addicted mother and how bullies at school tormented him.  The acting and filming were so good, a film perfectly cast, that I needed to give it a second try.  I'm glad I did.
I felt like I was watching a film specifically made to win an Oscar.  All the social criteria are there.  It is actually a very boring film with a very predicable story line.
I have not written a review on movie for quite sometime but this overrated movie forced me to say few words. Like many of other, i became the victim of the hype of this movie. Other than the fact it was snail paced movie, it failed to leave any impression and made no sense at the end. Some actors were good but didn't understand what was so special  about Mahershala Ali's acting. He received an oscar for that and I truly don't get the reason. He was good but nothing extraordinary. 

Well in the end, i would not recommend this movie, however if you have patience and like to see what is the hype about, you should waste some time on it.
Very well done. Definitely see it.
A heavy film but unique in both its material and directive style. It is beautiful to look at and scored with powerful music. Pushes forward the genre in a great way.
buena, un poco cruda
Moonlight is a mighty testament to the power of one person's story. It's so sturdy it can be the black, queer, poor answer to a dozen beloved white-centered films -- American Pie, Sixteen Candles, Matilda. That would be enough, but don't make the mistake of assuming its appeal is as narrow as that of most white-centric films. It's also a boldly nonlinear coming-of-age story.
I cried so much in this movie
Moonlight felt like a very personal film made with an abundance of care and attention for every detail. The acting is great all around, at parts it's actually quite superb, and the casting I have to say was spot on. With a great soundtrack and a very emotionally touching score I really enjoyed Moonlight. It felt like something different and unique. Since it's a character driven film I found that while Barry Jenkins' directing and the film's cinematography is gorgeous to look at and the script and dialogue feels very authentic, I did not get to know Chiron's character that much during the film, and that definitely took away a lot from his personality and some of the enjoyability for me. This made it a lot harder for me to resonate with Chiron. It seemed to me that Moonlight's focus was at times a bit too much on showcasing the main characters struggles and the supporting characters, while not enough on actually building up an interesting personality for him.
absolute the best picture in 2016 after watching 3  times
Moonlight is not a film, there is no way that was a movie. I am convinced that I just watched real life events play out, that is how good this film is. Moonlight tells a powerful story about a young man trying to figure out what kind of person he really is. I won't spoil the details if you have not seen the film but I will tell you that this film is amazing. The acting is perfect, the directing is perfect, the script is perfect, the score is perfect, everything is perfect. Moonlight was truly an experience, and I would strongly recommend this film to anyone. I think this is a very important movie that everyone needs to see.
The profanity and ghetto talk didn't offend me; I'm sure they were quite authentic.  And the acting was excellent.  But the storyline was thin and not the least bit interesting or believable.
Gripping performances...but there have been much better "Best Picture" movies throughout the years.
Coming into "Moonlight" I had incredibly high expectations, after watching it win multiple oscars, and just seeing the amazing amount of praise it got. I can now say that after watching it, all of that has lived up to the standards, this movie is beautiful. Everything about the way this movie was shot was wonderfully done, the scenes were set up so that you could really capture how rough the environment that Chiron grew up in was. The acting was absolutely astonishing, especially by all three Chirones; Alex R. Hibbert (Young Chirone), Ashton Sanders (Teen Chirone), and Trevante Rhodes (Adult Chirone), all three of them, plus pretty much everyone else in this movie contributed greatly to the quality of the movie. The pacing was also very well done in this movie, every scene held importance, however I feel like they had the opposite problem that most movies have, instead of going on too long, "Moonlight" almost goes too short, as I feel as though some parts to the story go unanswered, because the main focus of the story is on Chirone and his life, however I would've liked to see some of the subplots surrounding the side characters tie up completely, and I don't feel as though that happened. Still, though, "Moonlight" deserves all the praise it gets, and is most definitely among the top movies of 2016, and is definitely worth the watch.
Slow and borderline boring at times.
The beginning of a man's life. Not a criminal, not a politician: just a man. 10 minutes in, I felt no regrets. Half way through, I felt so satisfied with movies in a while.
Moonlight is one of those rare films that, in terms of dialogue, less is more, and it works beautifully from start to finish. The performances are grandly intelligent, and each character feels genuinely pure rather than written. This is what real cinema is.
Lost my interesting... Maybe I had a big hope before watch it. Successful "initiation" setting, but it does not grab me into the story, I always have distance with the character...but my favorite part is the swimming scene, interesting angle, like to receive baptism.
Nowhere near the hype
Fairly slow and boring.  Can't possibly see how this won the Oscar.  Politics?  La La Land was infinitely better.
Well acted and well shot but went on too long for my liking
Moonlight is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece.
I think moonlight is one of he best LGBT movies I've seen. As a non straight black person its relatable. Having to hide who you truly are and waiting to be comfortable is a struggle and it's like the movie tells us we aren't alone. Chiron is a super relatable character in more ways than one. 

The only thing I didn't like is the beach scene. Too instant.
How this movie got good reviews is beyond me!
This movie is nowhere near the hype it was given. good but it wasn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination. It was long drawn out and generally boring plus it didn't really resolve anything. His mentor dies with with a pale nod and no explanation as to why. He becomes a handsome buff man but doesn't have sex once in 10 years I find that pretty implausible. I wouldn't watch it again.  I m really amazed it got an academy award. Somebody drank the koolaid in oscar town
A beautifully acted, well written character piece.  I don't want to use the word brave because I think that's how its diminishing the overall critique as a complete film.  Important subject matter, perfectly acted but feels incomplete in its attempt to be a narrative piece.  I do think its been overpraised, yet happy for it's accolades and positive attention. An important film, but lacking some marrow on the bone.
Even though it displays great performances (with Mahershala Ali standing out), an unique sense of realism and one fine cinematography and explores life itself, with all that it entails, along with numerous themes (growing up, racial discrimination, homosexuality, drug addiction, morality, family issues, and more) through the eyes of black people, "Moonlight" will definitely satisfy critics and cinema professionals but, for a film whose message is intended to reach all audiences, in spite of its all-black casting, it tries too much in just 110 minutes and loses itself in a three-part product that feels too short (and at the same time, too long, since the overall pace is quite slow) and inefficiently developed, for any average or unexperienced viewer will hardly empathize with any character or any situation, and will be left searching for an epic-scale film that does not exist.
It might be a good story, but I would not have given it BEST PICTURE. I found it a bit lacking.
Amazing. Love the plot, though sometimes things were hard to follow, but other than that the film was a powerful explanation of life in black communities in the US.
Good direction of the characters and history, as well as giving them depth.
However, I do not see the masterpiece of which it is spoken.
It kinda leaves you with saying "okay...". nonetheless it's worth a watch.
ANY & EVERY OTHER movie released last year should've won the Oscar over this waste of time! I did not enjoy Moonlight one bit! It's the only movie in my IM DB Check-in's that I've rate 1-star and I only signed up for RottenTomatoes so I can cast my half-of-a-star voice disappointment. Moonlight is just terrible!
Just not good at all
i can't believe it win!! i didn't like it at all!!
Without a doubt deserves film of the year. The cinematography, thematic presence, and overall story have me at a loss for words. Truly a remarkable film.
Intriguing due to the subject.
A well paced drama that takes you down an unfamiliar road of sexuality, dysfunctional family life and reputation vs personal choice. The cinematography is superb and acting carries the film. Haunting and a soul searching tale of a young man seeking emotional comfort.
It deserved best picture
A Good Film but Not Oscar Worthy.  It was hard to tell if Chiron was just socially awkward or had a mental disorder. Not until late in the film do you understand what's going on with his character. Mahershala Ali was great though. I would have liked to see more done with him in the film.
For me just an average movie with an important life story involved.  Shows the double struggle of growing up by being black and on top of that being gay.  At times it was tough to watch the maing characters struggles, but a movie that tells the story decently.  For me I saw this movie because of all the obvious hype, and agree that the acting was over the top, but all through the movie seemed like something was missing that I can't quite put my finger on!
This was very a very new experience for me in terms of movies and topics. I wasn't expecting what happened, to happen in the movie. Great movie though.
Du fort bon cinéma, pas de doute. Moonlight est franchement bien ficelé. Ce n'est pas un chef-d'oeuvre, mais le moment est intense. Crédible. Je me se suis laissé embarquer dans l'histoire, car voilà bien ce qu'est Moonlight, une histoire bien racontée.
A bit underwhelmed. Felt like a long film.
Heartbreaking and tender. Powerful performances by the entire cast, including the kids at the start. Well worth the watch, and well deserving of every Oscar they received.
He described the American Society in one of it's sides perfectly!
great movie I can see how it won best picture
Worst movie I have seen in a long time - Absolutely NOTHING HAPPENS!  2 hours wasted time I will never get back!  My wife and a couple of co-workers agree - If there were minus stars available this movie would get a few.
Well shot/edited yet patronizing and unrealistic.
sparse and brutal, tense, nerve-wracking and harrowing
This movie is great 3/4 of it, the last part seems rushed and feels like they didn't know how to end it. However it is very interesting to watch and analyze from a different point of view of how to tell a story that no one wants to talk about but it's there and it's real and it's very human.
It could've been so much better than what it is right now.
Every actor in this film deserves an Oscar!  Casting was excellent.  I never once felt that anyone was reading a script.  Sensitive material extremely well done.
Pelicula totalmente irrelevante y sin buena historia
This movie doesn't not focus on making a point. It simply tells a story of a person, and his life. There are no flash-back sequences, or moral lessons. Why it won an Oscar is beyond me, but most of the theatre left wondering 'what the fuck'? Nonetheless, if you like a movie with no obligation to prove a point, then this is for you. It's good, but missing that emotional hook we are used to with hollywood-style movies.
Very Booooring..... I watched pushing the fast forward button every 5 minutes.
After all the hype and the glowing praise, and yes it's a stunning visual meditation on identity, violence, and reconciliation but it's very difficult not to be overwhelmed by the inherent homophobia and the downplayed erotics of it.. a little step for gay black men but still a lot to go. The film stripped bare any erotic semblance and drowned any notion of desire in the pathos of emotional trauma of black violence and homophobia. There could not have been two characters unsexed as these two. Even if the film was an emotional and visual triumph I still cannot overcome such absence or willful omission. Heterosexual or not, the director and actors should have known better.
IDK...just seems all the "Oscar" nominated movies were so sad this year... :(
Great movie in showing what some go through in day to day life growth, challenges and change. Drama, suspenseful at times, several wow moments and several aww moments. I'd watch it again ????
Dragged in a little bit but this is a story of a situation I haven't even considered before let alone watched.
Outstanding and touching!
One of this award season's hottest movies, eventually winning the best picture Oscar. The black boy is "different" (turning out to be gay) and doesn't know what to do about it. There are three stories, portraying him as a youngster, teen and a grown-up.

The movie is good but never exceptional and thus not really worth all the hype it has gotten so far. Sure, it's quality work but not reaching some dazzling heights that 224 movie awards and 204 nominations are hinting at.

I am disappointed by Mahershala Ali getting a best supporting actor Oscar for this. I mean, I really like the man - especially in Netflix's "Luke Cage" -, but his screen-time is so limited that he's barely in the movie! Is it really worthy of the Oscar?
a bit heavy but still a good movie
Gay stories are severely lacking in cinema and when gay characters do exist, they're rarely done justice, commonly portrayed as sidekicks or stereotypes. But Moonlight, by indie African American director Barry Jenkins, is an extraordinary coming of age drama that lays the struggles of one gay man front and centre, while asking difficult and open ended questions about the nature of masculinity and sexuality in African American culture, issues rarely explored on the big screen.

The story, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world growing up in 'da hood'. It is a heartbreaker of a film, incredibly moving and of staggering depth and subtlety, a coming of age drama both specific in its subject while universal in its theme.

The narrative has a triptych structure. Across three moments in the life of its main character, Chiron (played by three different actors), it communicates how difficult it is if you are black and gay in a community in which masculinity is strictly defined and demanded.

This story of an impoverished life of a young, gay black American is full of powerful performances from its cast. The style of the film demands that much is conveyed with no dialogue and its extraordinary performances meet the challenge.Trevante Rhodes and Mahershala Ali are both outstanding, and it's a stunning turn by André Holland. The film is also dazzling, visually intoxicating cinema, sensually and mesmerically shot. It has incredible flow moving easily between the desperate events without ever seeming merely episodic. 

A symphony in three acts, Moonlight is at once a vital portrait of contemporary African American life and an intensely personal and poetic mediation on gay identity, family, friendship and love. Moonlight is a sublime achievement and a groundbreaking piece of cinema. And a richly deserved awards winner.
Very disappointing after the reviewers hype. It may be a sensitive story but over long and dull. Did not deserve the oscar counting figures and la la land were much better.
Maravillosa, emocionante, todos los Oscars de los últimos años se merece.
This was a great cinema experience but left thinking there was too much imagery (water etc) and not enough plot. At times more like a piece of art than a film. Call me a heathen.
This is a good movie. Cant find a flaw with it.
Extremely boring and disappointing for and oscar winning film. Good story but could not get any connection with main character as he was so dry and emotionless.
Best movie I've seen in years! It was moving. Beautiful portrayal of nurturing masculinity. You will fall in love with this movie.
Raw, powerful and emotional.  The acting really made the audience feel the desperation and hopelessness of growing up in that environment.
Strong performances and hypnotic cinematography bring to life a film about self-discovery.
Phenomenal.  The closest thing to a masterpiece that I have seen in the past year.
OPERATIC BEAUTY AND SADNESS
Great structure in storytelling.
Intimate.
Even though Moonlight is a very very sad and touching movie, it still has no such kind of meaningful meaning, watching a few guys having a bad and miserable life doesn't show us anything useful. Highly Overrated!. Not Best Picture quality.
Boring. Can't trust critics rating. Never trust what the oscars say about movies. Waste of time watching this movie.
Saw the movie after it won Best Picture. Is it a good film? Yes. Is it the best film I saw out of all that was in the category? No. However it is a good story and I did enjoy Ali's performance.
Brilliantly acted, and a nice story. I just didn't find it very exciting or interesting.
A film not overly obsessed with dialogue but instead setting a mood with music and visuals; allowing the audience to see things as the protagonist is seeing and feeling things. Moonlight is not only a story for a gay audience to relate too but also for anyone who has experienced bullying, family struggles, minorities, growing pains, and life mistakes and struggles. A beautiful film that if given a chance can make us all feel a bit more compassionate and understanding towards the differences of others.
I can't believe this won best picture. Started off good but  worsened as it went on, only to find this movie is a story about a gay man...smh disappointed.
Finally saw this. Very happy for it's best picture win. A stirring tale from director with a bright future ahead of him. In this slice of life, we meet young Chiron and see an intense complicated life play out in 3 acts. Worth your time!
What a snooze-fest. Yawn!!!
A gripping and emotive story which moves quickly enough to ensure the audience are not left wanting for more 'action' from the, otherwise, fairly dry storyline. Excellent soundtrack, fantastic acting performances from all incarnations of the protagonist.
Oscar winner. Really? Didn't rate it
stunning film! beautiful color tones & music.
This movie was even better than I hoped, even though I didn't see it until the buzz had built up my expectations for quite some time.
An interesting film to go see on St. Patrick's Day. I must admit I didn't really like it watching it in the moment. I wasn't fully drawn in to the film. I certainly didn't feel like I watched the Best Picture of the year. When we made it home Carla said to me over our Tequila cocktails that this would have been a good one to have seen at TIFF where you could hear from the producer and actors. This is where the 'Luck of the Irish' (firmly Canadian, proud of my immediate Scottish descent drinking a product of Mexico) kicks in. Thank you Greg Leclair (lucky to have known you) for making TIFF a part of our lives. Thank you TIFF for having uploaded the after film Q&A with the Moonlight producer and actors to YouTube. It took us back in time remembering all the good and some VERY bad films our friend Greg exposed us to. It also gave us a stronger appreciation for a film that left us with questions in the theatre. It made us think. It was gritty. The acting was very good. I'm still not convinced it deserved the Oscar.
Movie sucks! How the hell it won a Oscar beats me! Smdh
Everything Boyhood wanted to be but better
confusing just like the characters in the movie
This hands down, has to be one of the worst films I have ever watched. It will be the last time I ever watch a film based on the Tomatometer rating alone. It had little or next to no compelling, interesting story whatsoever. It was edgy, you don't know what is going to happen and you're waiting for something bad to happen, in the end nothing at all happened. Absolute load of rubbish.
it earns its best picture win with strong performances, and an understanding of its characters without judgement. Powerful from beginning to end.
An amazing perspective of a person who grew up in an environment that doesn't understand and tries to bury the feeling that person has. Story like this can be applied to many other situations all around the world and doesn't have to be about being gay or black it can be about anyone who is forced to changed because of the surroundings.
Disappointing. The most boring Oscar winner I've ever watched. @valeriacoelhochutrau #boring
Everything, that's wrong with today's world rolled into one is this atrocity winning "Best Picture". It seems, that everyone has forgotten, what "cinema" is about.
We watched this last night and it was an interesting drama about the struggles of  some people.
tells the story of a young black man living in a rough neighbourhood of Miami. Childhood, teenager and an adult, in 3 defining chapters in the movie brings to life his struggles of growing up. Three of them portrayed by different actors and each of them very well done. Simple & beautifully made by Barry Jenkins. A good watch.
Quite possibly the worst movie ever to win any award much less Best Picture. What a joke and just shows how out of touch from reality Hollywood really is.
Not really sure what all the fuss was about
There is too much praise over a movie that isn't bad, but is also not great. The story is fairly bland and it doesn't have nearly as much depth as it thinks it does. I did feel that the cinematography was excellent, and it was a well-made movie from a technical standpoint. There is no way this should have truly won the Academy Award for Best Picture though. (First and only viewing - 3/29/2017)
Moonlight's excellent structure in storytelling, its powerful performances and thematic vision really emphasizes the film's sense of self-discovery. A unique presentation, filled with a superb use of music, colors, cinematography, and combined with its sheer drama makes this a monumentally notable tale of a lifetime that audiences can empathize with. 4/5
This coming-of-age drama, by director Barry Jenkins, about growing up as a gay black man in the drug-infested, housing projects of Miami, is given the art-school treatment. The central conceit here is to depict three stages of the protagonist's life in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as portrayed by three different actors. In the first segment, Little (Alex Hibbert), a near mute boy, is befriended by a drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) and his wife (Janelle Monae) to escape his crack-addicted single mother (Naomie Harris). In the second segment, Chiron (Ashton Sanders) is still a withdrawn teenager but he shares an intimate sexual encounter with another boy that leads to betrayal. In the final segment, he's unconvincingly transformed into Black (Trevante Rhodes), a muscular, chaste drug dealer whose physicality obscures his psychological and emotional trauma as he reconnects with his lost love (Andre Holland). The movie was widely acclaimed as a rare, honest depiction of black male identity, masculinity, and sexuality, but its the kind of movie where critics congratulate themselves for their progressive sensitivities. Despite the innovative conception, the central character is too opaque and passive, so the movie lacks depth and the dialogue is often didactic. Superb performances by Ali, Harris, Monae, and Holland help to compensate. Lyrical cinematography by James Laxton. Written by Jenkins, based on a story by Tarell Alvin McCraney. Won Oscars for Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali), and Adapted Screenplay.
Moonlight was a challenging yet important task for the film industry- it confronted difficult social situations and brought light to the complex and confusing times of adolescence. Its attention to nuance both in script and in cinematography was what made the movie the large success that it was. Additionally, It was an especially important moment for African Americans in film, as it offered many important roles (and subsequent award nominations) to this minority, as they empowered the black identity as well as the homosexual identity- important on their own, and at their intersection.

Pacing really hurts this one, loved Ali's acting but other than that a movie that doesn't try enough to make you feel the pain of the main character. I was disappointed, don't know how this film beat the likes of Hidden Figures, Fences, or La La Land.
I didn't really want to see this film, but after it won picture of the year, I figured I had to give it a try.  Yes the performances are great, and the cinematography is beautiful, but besides that, I could not get invested in the story.  It seems so many of the award winning films have too many slow moving scenes and are not movies I would want to watch again.
Beautifully crafted almost to poignantly real, stunningly shot with precise and wondrous editing, and heartbreaking acting from the entire cast (including Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris) prove that Barry Jenkins has created one of the most beautiful films of the year flawlessly.
So boring.  I had to watch it at 2X speed to make it through.  I can't understand all the hype for this movie.  The Oscar definitely should have gone to Deadpool.
I did not want to buy into the Oscar hype, but this was a really good movie. I know the basic plot going in. Closeted gay black man's life in three phases of his life. It was very well written and acted. I agree with Mahershala Ali's Oscar win. He has been one of my favorite actors already but the scene when he is asked if he was a drug dealer......Yo!!! Powerful. This is the second movie I have watched recently that showed a life I pitied. Definitely worth checking out.
Important subject matter for certain, but this won best picture?!

The three actors portraying Chiron were fantastic!  As was Naomie Harris, who portrayed his mother.
Slow, overlong and predictable. Acting was top notch but could not sustain  my interest to the end. No idea why it has been getting such amazing reviews.
If I could rate this movie with negative stars I would.  This is the epitome of a movie that is a darling of the critics and simply falls flat for most viewers.  My wife quit less than a third of the way through it.  A movie to me is used to educate, entertain and make you feel.  This simply plodded along for an hour and fifty minutes with not much to offer.
A bit too laboured but great acting
One of those movies that is so important, but so hard to like. It is ugly and gruesome story of poverty, minority rights and human beings. I don't think I can watch it again.
This movie is shout out to rid the #Oscarsowhite hashtag. Not to take away from the movie, it probably was not best movie deserving. The acting was powerful and the art of storytelling was sincere to a fault. Character development was fantastic. But the movie lacked innovation in filmmaking and I wasn't too happy with the handheld camera work.
It's a good movie don't get me wrong, but best picture winner? I'm not so sure
"Moonlight" tackles issues of sexuality, identity, repression, and isolation majestically.  However, sporadic moments of greatness and momentary marvelous performances aren't enough for it to be the sum of its parts.  This film was not the best picture of 2016, but it may have been the most important.
Excellent film!! Great acting!
not much really happens and not very groundbreaking. hugely overrated but still better than La La Land.
Moonlight was your typical Oscars nominee movie; artsy and slow at times. The story line was ok not great.
Beautifully done ! (No homo)
My opinion---

I can already say that I discovered a magnificent film if any, I really liked this film and the depth that it released felt it all along on a subject how often worked, Barry Jenkins "Médecine pour Mélancolie- (2008)" might have fallen into the cartoon, but he did very well with this beautiful dramatic story, divided into three parts: childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This film also denounces the wickedness of young people to the difference and the impact they will have on their lives, and Moonlight will not deviate from the rule: a violent father, a prostitute mother and finally the drug and Violence to crown it all. When you read these adjectives, you will quickly understand in what atmosphere the film will lead you, you transpose this one to two young black Americans, you will tie the whole with a great friendship between these two personages who will pass through the childhood, the adolescence And then the adulthood, the whole will be carried out in a great complicity and a great modesty. The realization of Barry Jenkins is perfect, the scenario although already folded is nevertheless superb, the proof, it obtained the oscar of the The three actors who play the respective roles of childhood to adulthood are wonderful in their interpretation and give even more depth to the film. The images are absolutely magnificent and the shots are chosen with great accuracy. Moreover, he has made a magnificent atmosphere to the film, which makes it even stronger, it is a powerful work and will not spread But by marrying all these sets that will make this film beautiful, there is of course a position on the subject of sexuality (homosexuality itself) but the subject is treated with great modesty and this Film will be even more beautiful having been treated this way by Barry Jenkins. To finally arrive at the music of the film, wonderful and which will accompany each emotion in the film: "The Middle of the World" by Nicholas Britell (Moonlight Soundtrack). In conclusion: I can say that I discovered a magnificent film with incredible emotions, saying that it deserved the Oscar in relation to "La La Land" there, I'm sure, but I also loved, " You will not kill "and" Fences "two who would have largely earned the Oscar for best film. This is a wonderful film that I advise to see for all the positives detailed in my review

Naomi's Harris is absolutely stunning, what I don't understand is how did Mahershala Ali win a Oscar for only being in the film for 25 minutes and yet I don't even know how he die. Moonlight is just about what people of color that lives though poverty has to go through. Especially being a person of color that is gay, you will go through a lot. I give credit to Barry Jenkins who did a great job directing the film. Hopefully this is a life lesson, no matter who you are, the color of your skin, don't give up. Life goes on and it is okay to be LGBT because that is who we identify as now.
Moonlight was one of the best films I've seen in a while! They took the time to develop the characters, and I really enjoyed the story. The acting was also superb! It was different and refreshing!

Some people walked out the movie during certain scene, and that was distracting, but it's their loss. They missed out on an excellent movie!
A little overrated to me...
Beautifully shot with a story that shows a side of the society we normally don't see. Truly deserving of the best film academy award.
Moonlight builds its main subject with substance-filled chapters, acted by brilliant and compelling actors, in a rare fascinating story while dealing with difficult issues, race and sexuality, while fighting the pressures of life.

This is Director Barry Jenkins' first Oscar Award winning piece, but before this, he's already known for his style, for he fills the silver screen with detailed masterpieces apart from it being visually captivating. He doesn't do movies for the visual pleasures, there's always a story behind every angle of his film.

Moonlight is divided into three chapters, all with the lead being performed by three different actors whom all provided a soul to their character, Chiron.

The first part is titled "Little", which entails Chiron's isolation as a kid, for different reasons like bullying and his mother being a crack addict. The second called "Chiron" where, in his adolescent years, began to question or be curious of his sexuality, and still the bullies in school that made his inner beast came to life. The third is "Black", a full grown Chiron, who is now a drug dealer, following the footsteps of his mentor Juan (Mahershala Ali).

Moonlight is so grounded in its character development, but it never went dull. Every scenes is based on the character's perspective, which is filled with searing emotions all throughout without focusing other than its subject matter.

waste of my life I can't get back
Visually appealing, well acted, but there did not seem to be enough dramatic flair to the movie. it was a little slow but overall a good movie
This movie sucks and so does Hollywood's opinion of a great movie. Made it about fifteen minutes before I wanted to rip my own face off out. Can't help but to think they were awarded best picture for their race. In any case, cheers to you for your award but your movie is horrible.
Looking forward to seeing this movie.  Waited a long time for it to play in our area.  What a disappointment.   Can't believe it won best picture.
Execellent movie!!!!!
what a beautiful movie...confusing and sensible at the same time. nothing like anything I've ever seen and will be hard-pressed to experience something like it again sadly.
this was really emotional and sometimes hard to watch, but it's so beautiful in such an original way. There's so much to learn just by watching this. the performances were great. the more I think about it, the more I think this is a film I'll remember for a long time.
This move was awful! Might be the worst movie I've ever seen. What was the point of this movie??? To find out the kid likes men. The story line sucked!!!
One of the best movies of all time.
Sewn together with some coincidences a-la Fruitvale Station. This bittersweet melodrama fits as a time capsule for the today's cultural climate while the drama is slightly engaging.
/A-/ An extremely well-crafted film. Deserving of the praise it is receiving.
I found it slow in parts and a little predictable, although I liked the edginess of the main character and the acting was believable.
Phenomenal movie! I had to see what the hype was about. Definitely a must see.
Moonlight is a powerful and beautiful metaphorical film about identity and intense human emotion. It allows you to enter and follow a life that many have never considered living. The plot is very tasteful and mature, the acting is superb all around, and the cinematography is exquisite - enough to form empathy, understanding, and art. Rating: 8.1/10
filmov ne e losh, ali daleku od toa deka e odlicen film, ili pak strasno dobar film za da dobie Oskar...ako ovoj i La La Land se takvi filmovi, a bea najgolemi konkurenti za Oskar, kakvi li se drugite fimovi? :)
A poignant and heartbreaking story of love and growing up told from a perspective we haven't seen a lot in movies.
It was good but not Oscar good.
Berührendes & inszenatorisch sehr intimes Außenseiterporträt über Erwartungen, Menschlichkeit und Vorurteile.
Good movie with high profile themes, well acted but probably had too high hopes due to Best Picture Oscar
Well, this is probably one of the most overhyped films I've come across. The premise is excellent and it could have really pushed a lot of boundaries, but the whole experience was just shallow. For a film based solely off the idea of a character study, the character in question was just flat-out boring. There was no depth to him at all at any of the three stages of his life. Making a character gay and having that as the main premise doesn't make a character interesting, but even the handling of his sexual orientation was rubbish. There was no commentary on it whatsoever, and there wasn't even any chemistry between him and the man he was supposed to be in love with. With a film broaching deep topics such as a growing up black slums amongst crime, with an abusive parental upbringing and being beaten around for being gay, the film just tip toes through these things without offering any real breadth. It never gets its hands dirty. 

Oh, and the ending was just plain shocking. You sit through two and a half hours of a character study and the film won't even give a proper conclusion to the character in question? Terrible. 

2 stars because the cinematography was interesting, as was the music.
An ordinary story of a poor black boy growing up and fallen into crime.  no plot, no great scenes or moral... NOT THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR...
A beautiful film that portrays a much needed story in today's society that is still quite overhyped. Felt far too short considering the subject matter and story plays it a little loose & safe. Wish it just offered..... more.
Negative 5 review. Horrible movie!
Utter rubbish!!! Including travel time, that was 2.5 hours of my life I wish I could get back!!!
Enjoyable.  The story drew me in and I liked seeing him change as he grew up.  I was a little disappointed in the ending but overall a good picture.
Good character development. Non-story.
This movie really choked me up at the end, but it hit me most about 30 minutes later after I processed more of what had happened.  I feel like the movie was beautiful and sad.  Seeing how Chiron abandoned himself and transformed himself to fit a certain image in chapter 3 just really killed me.  The other thing I noticed was with Kevin's character in chapter two with how he allowed his peers and his situation to shape his identity. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't check this out.
Beautiful photography, great acting and casting. Hard and soulful at the same time. A story that needed to be told.
I really lover this film. It was beautifully filmed and so well acted. Such a poignant display of love and conflict.
How did this even get nominated?
A simple film done well.  Overall performances were good by most of the cast with a couple of strong scenes but I was only surprised and impressed by the cinematography and how the scenes were lit.  Fairly smple but the mix of colours from the various artificial lighting, mixing the bright fluorescents and LED with warm incandescent was balanced very beautifully in many of the dark scenes.  I don't believe this is a Oscar winning worthy film though, but it is very good for what it is, a simple low budget indie art house film.
Micheal Bredeweg, Greg Bird, and I watched this last night. It was this year Best Picture. I was drawn into the emotions that kids have in trying to understand their world and where they fit. Navigating the complexity of relationships with peers, family, environment, etc can make life overwhelming! 

My rating system:
5 Stars - I am glad I watched this movie, I recommend other watch it, I will actually watch it again
4 Stars - I am glad I watched this movie, I recommend others watch it 
3 Stars -I am glad I watched this movie 
2 Stars - I wish I did not watch the movie
1 Star - I wish I did not watch the movie, I will recommend others to not watch it
There is a lyrical quality about 'Moonlight'. The central character, Chiron, grows from young boy to young man in a pool of loneliness. He changes and changes himself externally but remains the same inside. Do we all remain, essentially, who we have become by the time we are twelve? A good film. Watch it.
Superbly directed and acted.

Wasn't expecting the mid plot. Did slow down at the end but overall very good and a worthy winner of best picture oscar.
A very strong first act that only dwindles away as the film progresses. The character development wasn't enough for best picture status.
sorry but when something wins best picture it must live up to high expectations, and for me this movie just didn't. It dealt with really controversial themes and there was some really good acting. However this was just a boring movie and I feel it's rating is more political than anything. Come back in ten years time and it won't have the legs.
Moonlight disappointed me, primarily because it could easily have been a much better movie  

Director Barry Jenkins takes the main character, Terence, beyond brooding, alienated, and painfully withdrawn... all the way to boring.  

We were deprived of Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Mahershala Ali's outstanding acting only 10-20% of the way through the story and - along with it - an abrupt end to the first of many story lines.  

The cast (other than Ali) did not provide compelling performances, too many ideas and characters were never developed, and perhaps the only truly unique twist to the central theme was that the main character was gay. Even many influences of the latter were never well-explored.

Taken together, these are the main reasons why I thought Moonlight was an interesting concept and story, but could have been a much better movie.

By way of comparison, my standard reference for the theme of Black children coping with desperate inner city environments, devoid of hope, is the 1994 film "Fresh".  We could quibble about differences in details between the two movies, but everyone from the writers to the director to a young Sean Nelson (supported by Samuel L. Jackson and others) did a better job than did their Moonlight counterparts. 

Fresh - as a story - certainly had at least one distinct advantage.  Unlike Moonlight, which ended with a quasi-cliche sense that a kid with Terence's reality will become a victim of his environment (except for the resolution of his long suppressed homosexuality), Fresh offered a very interesting perspective on how a kid might be able to do better than that... even if he cannot escape his environment.

I do not understand how Moonlight could have been voted Best Picture because, not only do I think it was not, I do not consider it even among the best 2016 films focused on the lives of African Americans.

Fresh was ahead of its time and - for what it is worth - if both films had been released in 2016, I believe far more Best Picture Oscar votes would have been garnered by Fresh than Moonlight.
Best Movie..sad subject....but well acted and directed...
BORING, worst movie I saw in the last year.  What a stinker
1/2, only because I can't give 0
The Number 2 in my Top 15 Movies Of The Year!
The direction and perfomances in this movie make history!
Well done, surprised the kid was not nominated for awards.
really good a lot of people were put off by the "twist" but once you get past that a great insight into what that struggle must be like.
Shocked that this movie won the Oscar.  Not at all impressed.
I don't  know this movie won best picture, it was total caca. And Mahershala Ali winning best supporting actor? he was the worst actor to ever play a "Cuban" in my life. Hollywood threw a bone this year to make people stop boycotting their shows, horrible! I am sad because I wanted to enjoy this movie so bad being that its a gay love story shot in Miami. but it was truly terrible.
"It's a film that's a film," or in other words thereâ< are no words that can properly describe it. If you want to know more you should probably watch it.
This is a different type of movie, and you'll know it is right from the start. But overall, a solid movie that I'm glad I saw.
I don't get what all the hype is about.
I guess this was supposed to be a touching story about two men in love and all the travails they suffered along the way.  Tired of seeing black people portrayed as drug users, prostitutes, and messed up human beings.  Tired of the user of the N word, and aunt jemima languag.e.  Hollywood,  if you want to make a movie like this, make one with more dignity.  Yes the characters were memorable, but not more memorable than many other movies.  Hard to believe this won an Oscar for best picture.
Sorry as usual top critic movie not worth the viewing time.
Wow, La La Land was a lot darker than I expected.
Moonlight beautifully encapsulates life's hardships with its well profound protagonist. Barry Jenkins direction is gorgeous to say the least, and the films story can be emotionally overwhelming at one point, and beautifully touching in the next. Moonlight is a work of cinematic splendor that will stick with viewers years to come.
Very nice directed, but not an influential film.
Beautiful story, excellent cinematography. Perfect from the beginning to the end. No wonder it won best movie of the year.
Naome Harris (the drug addicted mother) and Mahershala Ali (the drug dealer) were awesome. I just wished the writers had kept them in the second half of the movie. Instead the producers concentrate more on the relationship between the two guys. Boring as hell. I fell asleep.
This was a beautiful and heart-wrenching film.
I watched this movie expecting a deep engaging story but ended up with questions never answered, no connection with the characters and a strong feeling of How the hell was this movie even mentioned in the Oscars.
Why didn't they finish the movie?
Interesting characters, just not my style. No story arcs.
Silence as a tool, emotions as a guide. A masterpiece.
I understand why it won the oscar for best picture as a social statement and to create awareness that these lives exist , but it's a slow predictable movie
Liked it, didn't love it. The performances, however, were outstanding. Especially the actors who portrayed Chiron...they were fantastic.
This isn't a movie, it's a series of scenes that will make you feel feelings, but lack any cohesiveness. I really didn't think there was anything memorable about it. A lot of people say they loved this movie, but nobody is ever going to watch it twice
A bunch of brilliant performances, a resounding emotional journey. (3.5/5)
great lessons are taught in this movie great movie
A good film. Just not 'Best Picture' good. All the three actors portraying Chiron were amazing. Overall, I liked all the child & adult actors. According to me, there were some other nominees like 'Arrival' who were more deserving for the award.
Moonlight understands the power in the unspoken.  There is so much beauty and meaning packed into the subdued moments, the patient close-ups.  There are no twists here, no shocking moments, but the profound humanity in Moonlight makes it truly memorable
Amazing story telling on a topic that many still would find it hard to acknowledge. But the brave cast & crew make it really easy to take it in. It's slow & dark but extremely powerful. But is it the best film of the year? Not convinced enough. Nonetheless it is a cinema defining movie.
One of the most powerful coming of age movies. A worthy Oscar winner.
Brave and inspired original story... though not as flawless as I was led to believe given the accolades.
I didn't care for this movie got bored half but truly 30 mins in
An intricate and fundamentally important piece of storytelling. The movie is raw, real edgy cinematic work and some stellar acting performances. This is a powerful plot with a beautiful but real back setting. Brilliant movie.
Good film - you can tell it didn't cost a lot to make as the picture was quite dodgy but fantastic story line.... so glad he found love in the end... ????
A slow-burner but v beautiful.
Interesting premise, but plot lines are never tied up. The film drags the final 30 minutes and it clearly won best picture for "checking boxes", not for being the best film. I saw them all and this was clearly undeserving compared to the rest. Overall, this movie was good, but it is not the masterpiece people would have you believe
Incredible film. Not seen a film like this in a long, long time.
Best Picture Oscar Winner 2017 Review
**3.5 Stars**
Considering I could have written this review back in September, 2016 (after seeing Moonlight at TIFF) I kept putting it off until I started writing it in November.  Hadn't fully completed it, and in thinking I had saved it as draft, I soon found out that I had not.  Was it a harbinger or an omen to postpone it for a later time?  Especially with that Oscar mess-up fiasco which occurred at the end of this year's Oscar's telecast?  Possibly.  Where we left our friend's Oscar party right after La La Land was called Best Picture.  8 mins later I get a text saying they messed up: Moonlight was the actual winner.  I was like "you're PUNKING me?!"  Alas, it turned out he was not: Moonlight was the true Best Picture winner.
Did it deserve it?  *shrugs*.  It wasn't my top pick.  Same for La La Land: meh & not my top pick.  Arrival would have been my Best Picture pick.  Not to say Moonlight wasn't deserving of the kudos and praise, cause it was.  Especially for the acting by Alex R Hibbert as the first third of the movie's young "Little; by Ashton Sanders as the middle third's Chiron; and by Mahershala Ali (Best Supporting Actor winner) as the father figure to Little, Juan.  Trevante Rhodes (tv actor from Westworld), as the final third's Black, was also quite captivating, having to act through gold grill teeth with a complete lack of emotion and speech (compared to the verbose Little).  
As a gay guy, I didn't feel Moonlight was a "gay" movie.  To me, it was more of a movie surrounding the exploration and determination of someone's sexuality.  A lot of critics, reviews and hype has been made surrounding Moonlight being a "gay" movie or about gay sexuality.  Which - to me - wasn't the correct framing point or stance.  We all develop our sexual interests through different avenues, pathways and choices in life.  The events in the middle third of the movie - focusing on Chiron - mitigates the confrontation of sexuality in the Black's final third.  Moonlight is, more so, the impact and mental and psychological tug of war someone goes through to truly try to find out who they are and how they identify themselves.  Which - at the end of Moonlight - is still left up in the air.  A perfect way to end it by NOT making it a gay movie.
Because of how it was presented, I give total props to (Best) director and writer Barry Jenkins for his intimate, questioning, non-linear, non-surrender to gay cliché character drama.  Jenkins' direction showcases both the gritty, destitute, drug-run landscapes of Miami, Florida as well as the almost angelic, soul-saving moments of life, such as when Ali's Juan teaches Little to swim.  
At the same time, I also wasn't blown away by Moonlight because of its segmented, non-linear sequencing.  Jenkins shows us parts - the most impactful parts - of a character's sexual trajectory.  However, there is a lot is left out and not captured; moments of Little/Chiron/Black's growing up that is left in the cracks and spaces in between the specifically pinpointed chapters we are shown.  As such, Moonlight doesn't feel smoothly cohesive overall.  Possibly a minor gripe, but one that didn't make me jump up and down when it was correctively announced as Best Picture.
Also, I found Naomi Harris' (who I LOVED in 28 Days Later and Skyfall) portrayal of Little/Chiron/Black's mother Paula clichéd, "seen it done better," and not hard hitting enough (a la Monique in Precious).
And Janelle Monae (also seen in this year's Best Picture Nominated Hidden Figures) was a little too pretty and polished looking in her role as Teresa, Juan's girlfriend/partner.  
Again, maybe minor nitpickings, but ones that made it a good movie but not a perfect movie.
Just saw Moonlight yesterday.  Great acting, but have no idea how it won Best Picture over fantastic movies like Hidden Figures, Lion and Hacksaw Ridge.
A combination of brutal & beautiful.
the plight of a gay boy becoming a man in one of the roughest places in Miami made for a phenomenal movie. The direction they decided to take the movie was the perfect artistic choice; one that I thought they weren't going to take, but I was pleasantly surprised with part 3 goin the direction it did.
very interesting. new perspective for sure.
Let's first admit that there is a major drift in the contemporary film industry between what good filmmaking is and what content might be, the global scene is confused as to what really makes a good movie, and momentary social, cultural and political influences make this confusion far worse, and it's because of this that a movie like Moonlight ever received any recognition in the first place.

Technically, the film's reality is that it's completely amateurish, if I didn't know better I'd have thought it was a film school project at best, a screenplay that wants to say things but doesn't, a director who shoots whatever is available and moves to the next shot, and a horrible editing job that would be so bad even for a first draft it makes you lose any sense of pacing or story.

Basically it's a movie with a very specific audience that might appreciate it, and unfortunately, the people working on the Academy Awards are part of that demographic, but the movie will always fail to be universal, not because of its setting or its character, people loved City of God and it was celebrated worldwide, while Moonlight will never be because of all of its mediocre elements that hinder it from being relatable, unless you're an American justice warrior who wants to capture the bold lines of a story about a poor gay black kid growing up as a headline with total disregard to what the movie really is.

In 20 years, we'll look back and wonder how was it even possible for this mediocre piece to get half the recognition it received, because the momentary circumstances that lead to its acceptance would have changed, and that is not what cinema is about, cinema is meant to be universal and eternal, even if humanity as we know it has completely changed.
This movie doesn't deserve that high rating
I don't even know what to say! I guess I expected a whole lot more from this three part drama and it just left me wondering about a lot of things that were left unexplained throughout the film. Personally, I did not like it at all.
Moonlight is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. But it's too short for its kind of film resulting on its theme not being cultivated enough.
I watched this because of the Oscars.  Was it about growing up gay?  Was it about drugs?  Was it about bullying, dysfunctional home life?  It left more questions.......not a fan.
Many thought that La La Land was the huge favorite to win this year's Best Picture at the 89th Academy Awards.  While not the front-runner, there were a few (including me) that thought Moonlight had a very high chance at stealing that award and those predictions came to fruition recently.  While many see the film as the academy's answer to the "#OscarsSoWhite" backlash from last year, that was not the reason this film was praised by the masses.  The film's original story of a child dealing with identity issues complimented the amazing performance by the cast.  Combine that with Barry Jenkins' great eye for imagery and thus you have one of the best films of the year.
One of the best movies I have ever seen. the acting is phenomenal, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is beautiful. Some may say it is too slow, but I loved it. I would definitely recommend to anybody.
WEAKEST FIGHT SCENE EVER!!! LOL Really slow moving and boring movie. Me no like
Boring. La La Land should have won.
Great movie, even greater cinematography! Just wanted a better third act :/
Not a fan.  I had high expectations for this movie because it won an Oscar, but the movie was so choppy.  It didn't prove to be the artsy cinematic artistic type that I am a fan of.  Would not watch it again. Sadly disappointed
This movie is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Everything in this movie is perfect. The acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the camera work...is breathtaking. I can't find one real flaw in this entire film.
Highly overrated movie, I was never able to connect with the character. It leaves you hanging in the middle, weird camera angles shots for the sake of being different. What a pointless movie
Amazing Cinematography. Good acting. Boring
After seeing this film, comparing Moonlight to Boyhood feels a little bit shallow. While Boyhood uses age as a true set-piece, Moonlight uses age to tell a story about acceptance and belonging. For a movie that is based in Florida, it's hard for people to come into this movie not expecting a story about growing up in harsh environment. While the film does this fairly well, that is most definitely not it's focus.  The film can naturally speak to anyone who has ever experienced a feeling that only resides with time and understanding of one's self.
Moonlight is an absorbing and intelligent piece of cinema about identity that is well-directed by Barry Jenkins, though it moves achingly slow and only retells an idea much better portrayed on The Wire, and certainly without a doubt is not the best picture.
This was the picture of a lifetime! The cinematography, the story, the characters, everything was well worth watching. The fact that this a film with LGBTQ themes and with an all-colored cast are only a few reasons of many on why this was worth the Best Picture win.
It was long and confusing, interesting story that it was based on a true story, also sad
Excellent. Must see. Well Deserving of all the praise.
Don't waste your time
Construit sur trois actes parfaitement homogènes, ce qui est déjà en soi une énorme réussite, Moonlight est une remarquable étude de personnage, qui parvient à mêler énormément de thèmes sans pour autant que l'un cannibalise les autres. Les 3 acteurs qui jouent le rôle de Chiron parviennent à créer un personnage cohérent sans pour autant se ressembler vraiment, tandis que Janelle Monae et Mahershala Ali sont absolument parfaits. Moonlight est un film remarquablement mis en scène, tout en retenue et en douceur, sans jamais tomber dans le misérabilisme. Moonlight est un très grand film.
More than meet the eye and what meet the eye at fist glance is already quite good.
Boring boring boring.....
I guess I don't mind that this won best picture, despite the experience of watching the film being constantly stressful and draining.  Intellectually this does seem like an important movie.
It's a good movie but not for everyone. The acting was brilliant and for this kind of story I don't think there would be a better way to approach it. For me though it just isn't my cup of tea. It gets 4 stars from me because it really is a well done film.
When people ask me, "What was your favorite movie of the year?" I don't say Moonlight. When people ask me "What was the best film of the year?" I say Moonlight. This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn't being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel's performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won. The scene at the dinner table could have been his only scene in the movie, and he would have earned that Oscar. That is all. 9.2/10
The acting and visual storytelling are what drives this movie. I thought it was very well done and intriguing throughout.
The content and acting were good, but the directing left so much possibility unrealized. Would love to see this remade with a different director. It's a shame.
huge Movie! I love it
This movie is remarkable. The characters are raw, the scenes intense, all while drawing the audience back into adolescence and the question of one's identity.
Brilliant showing of the insecurities that stick with you throughout life, that everyone can relate to in one way or another, and how they can shape you.
How in the HELL did this win an Oscar???
A very good and thought-provoking film. I'm not sure it's best picture material, though.
The first 2/3, with the younger versions of Chiron, were especially well done. The bullying this poor kid dealt with especially connected with me. People can be so damn cruel to each other. 
I was a little confused as to how everyone, adults and fellow kids alike, somehow "knew" that little 10-year(?) old Chiron was homosexual. Seems a bit early to tell such things. Especially since the subject himself didn't even understand the accusations. 
I really liked Juan's character, but he sadly disappeared from the story quite early. No explanation given. 
The final 1/3(part) kind of took away from the film, in my opinion. I know we were supposed to see the effect of his life, but the actor they chose to play him at this stage just didn't fit for me. 
I also didn't like how the movie ended very abruptly. With a tad of hope, yes, but still so much to be covered. 
I do recommend the film. It's just a bit rough in execution.
Not my kind of movie. Didn't care for.
Moonlight is the last film to receive the academy award for best picture this year. Barry Jenkins has crafted a complicated coming of age story with a central hero who's incredibly complex and introverted. Beautifully shot, written and produced, the film follow the story of Chiron a young African American struggling with finding his place in this world and the constant bullying to which he is victim in school. We follow him through three main stages of his life, three portrait of a person trying to construct himself in a tough environment. This is an incredible film with a powerful message, a vibrant personal journey and a complex study of how African American men are trapped in the multiples ghetto-cliches we are used to see all the time of film and TV. Although the movie will not appeal to anyone, i really think it would be a miss to avoid watching it. It's such a rare thing nowadays to get the opportunity to watch such a beautifully crafted story with depth and brains. Please give it a go and make up your own mind.
Powerful film with some great acting and cinematography but not a film for me to watch.
This movie made me uncomfortable and I do not understand how it won an academy award.
Cheesy reunion film. Pushes black, male sexuality without adult males kissing. I won't remember this film.
a film about a young man struggling to find himself..whether its dealing with his drug addict mother or his own sexuality as well as bullying ..The film is told in 3 different chapters..Little, Chiron and Black. Great acting and beautifully filmed
Great director and cinematography, Character were well rounded with amazing performances by Naomi Harris and Ashton Sanders. 

BUT.... I can not be the only one that was BORED BORED BORED. I personally need a bit more plot to all these wonderful characters and apart from a few scenes this movie and the praise its getting is lost on me! I guess the point of some scenes is to build suspense but does it all amount to anything really in the end or have you just watched someone driving, eating, walking about for an hour of screen time. 

Sorry, not for me.
An interesting and provocative angle of the plight of the young black man growing up in terrible living conditions. All around a very well done movie, wonderful acting and character development.
Great acting, above average script. Not best picture in my opinion. This movie is the epitome of less is more
Kim and I finally caught the Oscar winner. Wasn't that impressed. We both thought Fences was the best picture followed by La La Land, then the rest of the field. Denzel was robbed.
horrible! if it was a woman and a man movie... no one would see it
Impactante y entrañable historia universal de identidad que, en cada una de sus secuencias, transmite un mensaje de empoderamiento y auto-aceptación. Fotografía impecable pero la historia poco a poco a mi gusto va de más a menos. No sentí esa catarsis que tanto esperaba. Sinceramente no sé si se merecía ser nominada como la mejor película pero sin embargo, las actuaciones son magnéticas atrayentes.
It's a subtle indie film to it. Good tale from the hood. But not really best picture quality. It's only a peace offering of the Academy due to the issue of them 'being so white' last year.
Slow moving. Some of the language is hard to understand. Good and sad revelation of the forces that return each generation of young men to the hood.
"Was there ONE white actor in this movie?!" was the first thing I heard as I left the theater after watching Moonlight, just a few hours ago. I also heard remarks such as "I'm not a homophobe, but," and "How could this piece of trash lose to La La Land." I was amused when I found out that those sentences came from the very same people that kept moving uncomfortably in their chairs, and talking out loud, and turning on their cell phones whenever the theme of homosexuality came up on the screen-which is pretty much all through the movie. A hell of a traumatizing experience, one might add. It wasn't. The movie is so powerful and captivating, and it carries such innocent sublimity that, in the end, the only thing that really annoyed me about my company was how come they couldn't appreciate such an honest, beautiful picture as that. Because Moonlight is more than necessary: it's beautiful.
Boring, no purpose, not thought provoking, why
boring boring boring. another movie you have to say how in the world did it win an Oscar.
What a wast of film and 2 hours of my life. The only reason this movie
won an Oscar was because of the subjects and subject matter and the
need to "diversify", not because it's a good movie.
Moonlight is the story of Chiron and his harsh life in Miami where he's trying to find both himself and a way to survive. The film follows Chiron through three phases of his life, all of which are pivotal in shaping the man that he becomes. I've heard from others that Manchester By the Sea has a very depressing feel to it. Well, Moonlight is no stranger to the darker side either. It suffocates you with sadness. You want it to stop but at the same time you know it's necessary.

I question some of the stylistic choices at times, my only gripe in addition to the fact that there are no cheer-worthy high points to look forward to. The film jumps around a bit, which would be fine if I didn't have to already contemplate the things I just saw. At times it felt like I had just eaten a healthy plate of food then went for a run directly after. 

For its flaws, however, Moonlight is highly original. It does more than offer a fresh perspective on a story that's already been done. Rather it takes you inside a story you've never heard of or seen before. How does one survive in Chiron's living conditions? Furthermore, how does one survive in Chiron's living conditions AND struggle with sexuality at the same time? These are just one of many questions this film challenges you to try and answer.

The film excels in a number of things, evoking emotion being one of the leaders. You would be hard pressed for your heart not to break as you watch Chiron grow in all three phases of his life. You want this kid to get a win so bad, but life continues to hand him a raw deal. I loved the consistency that all three characters used to bring this character to life. As he gradually developed into a man, he was still the same lost kid at his core. Awkward. Shy. Man of little words. One can't help but wonder how differently his life would have been had he grown up in the same environment the characters from La La Land did.

The real world isn't a fairytale and Moonlight does an excellent job of capturing this truth. It's a film that will stick with you long after you have watched it. I give it an 84.
Tough to agree with the academy on Moonlight. It seemed like a type of movie that was nominated because it touched on a sensitive subject in today's world. Acting was the one aspect of the movie I enjoyed but that's not enough to win best picture.
Plot was too predictable and boring. The dialogues, when there were any, were below average with nothing memorable or to give food for though. All in all a waste of time in my opinion.
Overrated and slow but a very well put together film which is strongly acted and shot. Certainly felt underwhelmed by the actual ending. There was an audible gasp from someone in my row that it ended the uneventful way it did
Didn't like at all....that is 6 ladies opinion.
Slow moving, average at best, coming of age story, stealing years of tropes and stereotypes to make it 'untouchable' by audiences. African American gay man, beaten up by bullies, growing up in the hood, his Mom is crack addicted... I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't the explosion of originality and artsy enchantment that, especially the Academy Awards, everyone oversold and over hyped.
If the viewer can ignore the usual Hollywood political agendas they will find an outstanding piece of cinema which is worthy of all recognition received!
excellent story...this could be anybody in modern day america..
Sad, but a great movie
Absolutely one of the worst movies ever. There is no plot. The episodes from the main character's life seem unconnected. Interesting characters disappear with no explanation.
If you're a fan of artistry in the filmmaking industry, this is the film for you. Barry Jenkins, a fairly new director to the big screen, delivers an outstanding adaptation of a story about adversity in more than one aspect of life. I like to keep these short and sweet, so please give it a try if you are craving incredible cinematography, a moving score, and powerful acting from a refreshingly unknown cast.
Horrible Movie - don't waste your time !
good but not great. I really don't understand the huge score it has. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie but I never once felt like I was in the presence of greatness while watching this movie.
Beautiful movie - and a day later, I'm can't stop thinking about it and and all the subtle themes that came up in the movie. A highly deserved best picture win!
1/2 a star for the music alone
Is this what you'd call "mumblecore"?
Realistic...  Brutal...  Visceral
Contrived to make politically correct points
This movies stays with you. I can't stop thinking about Chiiron.
Very well put together story of a black man growing up gay in Miami. Great acting pulling you into the drama of the interactions he had with peers and the help he received from a couple who became surrogate parents.
Masterpiece, deserved every award it got.
I totally went in blind!! Damn it!! Not really into it, the acting was ok but the film was very, very slow. Not sure about all the awards or how this is highly rated.
This is a very interesting movie. I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I didn't watch any trailers or reviews and all I knew about it was that a lot of people loved it and it won Oscars. But after watching it I can. say that I do think is pretty good but not great.

 It's a very slow movie at the beginning and it stays slow all the way through. It had a lot of interesting subjects and the characters did grow on me by the end but I don't think it was enough for me to like the movie as much as others. 

The best things about the movie is it's settings, the cinematography, and the use of colors and lighting throughout. You can tell they paid very much attention to detail all throughout. It's a very great looking film. I thought all the characters were interesting but it didn't have enough dialogue for me to really connect with anyone. I liked Mahershala Ali's character but I don't feel like I got enough of him to make a full connection. 

The main character and his mom where the two most fleshed out and by the end I did come to like their stories. But because of how the movie was set up I do feel like there was something missing from them and that the movie just needed something more. But other than that I still kind of liked it. It had a pretty good themes That You Don't See too much in black films set in the hood and I like that it didn't Focus too much on the drug aspect. 

In all, I do kinda see why people liked it so much. It's very much the Indie type film that draws right the Oscar voting crowd. And that's not a bad thing but it just wasn't fully my type of film but I still like it for what it is.
Didnt like this movie, to many things not explained...... Dont see the reason for all the hype...... Seems like its just pushin the agenda......
Not worthy of the Oscar for best picture
My opinion on the Academy award winner moonlight which I just saw tonight for the first time, Moonlight wasn't half as good as Manchester by the sea, Lala land, or Lion which were far better movies
Not impressed. The acting was very good but I got bored. The pace of the movie did not keep me hooked. Not sure why M. Ali got the Oscar; good acting, but his appearance was too brief. I kept expecting him to resurface in the plot, but he didn't.
you have to be kidding me!  WTF is wrong with people.. really this is junk and the critics need to really find new jobs.  This garbage won an award.  We are truly doomed as a society.  Consider the fact it lasted less than a few weeks in the theaters.. you have hacksaw ridge a classic that was entertaining and well written, but of course... not a mention.  What a joke.
A delicate look at life, specifically a side of life that many take for granted, as well as a technical marvel in its own right: it's no coincidence that every key scene is bathed in blue in some way. This is truly something special.
This was a raw ugly movie but artfully put together. You feel everything in this movie and it was beautifully executed
A very good movie details the trials and struggles of growing up in a rough neighborhood.  It also addresses the added struggled of being homosexual in that environment. Very good but not what I would call best picture.
Worst,....movie,....ever,...........boring,....Oscar for WORST picture of the year.  This movie was chosen as a token just to appease leftist communities and nothing more. The academy should be ashamed.
Moonlight is a powerful drama of self discovery with great performances and a fantastic script. This provides a well deserve academy award for best picture
This movie is HORRIBLE.  Boring, pointless, full of stereotypes and PC baloney.  His mother is a prostitute and drug addict.  Really??  Wow that's original.  We walked out of a movie for the first time since District 9.
Sensitive, powerful, exceptionally well done and in a word BEAUTIFUL
Boring beyond belief. At best Moonlight is an Indie Art House movie. 2017 continues to operate under a parallel universe. The critic herd that gave such glorious reviews staggers me. Did they even watch it? Moonlight won Academy Awards for Best Picture & Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for Best Director & Best Cinematography. Are you kidding me?  I thought there was some standard to be in the same class as Casablanca, On The Waterfront or Lawrence of Arabia. Moonlight does not even hold a candle to another nominee like Hidden Figures. Andy Warhol was before his time he could have won Best Picture for Empire with this Academy. Can we not at least operate under the premise that a Best Picture winner has to have some consistent entertainment value? Alfred Hitchcock once said that, "Drama is life with the dull bits cut out", which would have made Moonlight a very, very short film.
This won BEST PICTURE??? Faye Dunaway got it right the first time, La La Land IS the Oscar winner for "BEST PICTURE"!!!
Snail slow don't get academy award???
Moonlight is an amazing movie that broadcast the struggles of many surreal childhood issues in this world. It's brilliantly acted as well as it is directed. The movie manages to keep you interested and intrigued throughout the entire film while keeping s slow pace and drawing everyone watching inside of Chirons life. Not only was the cast perfect but the characters are full of depth and all add something to the story making them all useful.
Not a lot to say, as not a lot happened. I'm astounded this won Best Picture. There is really not much to it. Good acting but where's the substance? I hated it
Don't think this was worthy of the oscar
I'm sure it's a great movie but Lala Land should've won.
will (white) people realise how heartbreaking this is.. A  totally astonishing film, don't miss it
While I'm grateful La La Land (2016) did not win the Oscar Best Picture, Moonlight (2016) did not deserve the award either. If, like me, you thought the pace of Silence (2016) was slow, then you'll find Moonlight to be glacial by comparison. While there's nothing wrong with the performances in Moonlight, the best ones (Best Supporting Actor Mahershala Ali and the grossly underestimated and stunningly beautiful Janelle Monáe) are too brief and transitory. Naomie Harris is clearly too much of a 'gym rat' to make a convincing crack whore. Overall, the story would have benefited from a little exposition where there's hardly any now. For me, Hidden Figures or Hell or High Water were the best pictures of the year and I'm now convinced more than ever that Janelle Monáe should have been nominated for something at the Oscars. Mark's Grade: C+
ZERO RATING! WASTE OF TIME. GOOD ACTING. HORRIBLE STORY. MY 6 YEAR OLD CAN WRITE A BETTER STORY.
Arguably one of the bravest films of the year, Moonlight utilises subdued performances from a stellar (yet not particularly well-known) cast about the three stages of growing up as a gay, black boy in a poor family on the outskirts of Miami, with a drug-addict mother. If that doesn't have Oscar written all over it, I don't know what does. The only major issue here being the pacing in some areas- but otherwise, a delight.
Verdict: A-
Superior e muito mais estranho que os outros filmes do gênero, Moonlight conta um drama vivido de maneira sincera e ao mesmo tempo sentimental. É visível o amor de Barry Jenkins por sua história, por mais cruel que seja.
Naomie Harris e Mahershala Ali destoam demais seus personagens em seus momentos chave, sendo opostos, mas igualmente dramáticos.
No geral, Moonlight escorrega em seu tom formuláico de obra "real" em um mundo sem esperanças, mas, nem por isso, deve perder sua força num ano de filmes fortíssimos mas, senão pelo "casal" principal, Moonlight seria só mais um.
"Moonlight" is one the best movies about identity in recent memory! Its story fits perfectly in violent environments that had shape several young boys and girls, transforming them into the human beings they are today, without making them forgetting where they came from. Barry Jekins  is approved to continue making masterpieces like this,
reserving a place for himself as one of the best directors of his generation!
Best rim I've seen in a long time brilliant acting
We don't explore the world in this movie, we focus on a character one that thinks he is flawed, he is scared, and above all trying to find himself. That true intent to see what someone's life is, was, and will be is a thing of beauty in this near perfect movie. All parts are spot on with good direction, I must say my favorite and the highlight of this film is the great score.
Very well done film. Must see.
I thought the first and second acts were interesting, but the last act was awful. I couldn't even finish it. I guess that's the unpopular opinion considering all the awards it's won and the general rating, but it just wasn't for me.
BEST PICTURE 2016: Powerful drama about a black gay man growing up. Chiron goes on a discovery to find who he really is through a troubled upbringing and finding it difficult to fit in at school.
Moonlight is a decent low-budget indie movie.  Overall, however, it is flawed and the story isn't substantial enough to carry the weight of the meaning it strives to bring to the audience.  The first two parts are the strongest--the character of Juan contributes a lot to the theme, although it's a stretch to depict a drug dealer as politically correct.  But the relationship between he and Chiron has substance.  Unfortunately, he has died by part two, and there isn't a relationship to build upon to make up for it.  The relationship between Chiron and Kevin is underdeveloped, a tenuous friendship at best.  Part three is the weakest, however, as it has to carry the burden of climax and resolution.  It's hardly believable that the small, skinny, frightened kid grows up to become the character of Juan, as the adult version of Chiron seems disconnected from the childhood and teenage incarnations.  The connection between Chiron and Kevin, which should be the heart of the movie, seems undeserved since their characters were not developed enough in the earlier parts, and so comes across as strained.  
Despite the merits of this movie--breaking ground with a black, gay protagonist, I was left not feeling much of anything for either of these characters, and was disappointed in what Chiron had become.  It seemed there could have been a range of possibilities, had his character held more complexity than the tale of a black kid from a rough neighborhood with a drug-addicted mother.  And he happened to be gay, another underdeveloped element of this film (compare to Brokeback Mountain, where there was clarity and definition of the relationship between the central characters).
Excellent film. You will find yourself rooting for Chiron to find happiness.
A life in three acts. The first chronicling a bullied child who is mentored by a charismatic drug dealer. The second act details his struggles with bullies and emerging sexuality. Followed by the final act which is a glimpse of him as a young man. Fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and well-written dialogue. This is as good as it gets.
Important film, but I didn't see Oscar-worthiness for the film nor Mahershala Ali's win for best supporting actor.  Good performances, good story, and just good.  There was nothing great about it, and why it won for "Best Film 2017", I have no idea.  Lion is my choice.
It's a decent movie but way,way overrated. Not even CLOSE to being better than Hidden Figures and I preferred LaLa Land as well. The subject matter is important and should not be overlooked but way overrated as a movie.
I usually like to see the Academy nominated movies, to see the creme de la creme of movie-making.  However, I have been disappointed with some movies selected by the Academy (such as The Artist, several years ago), but I was also disappointed by Moonlight.  Although a good movie, I did not see Best Picture written all over it.  I believe that there were other films more deserving.
Moonlight shines on its own with its unique story-telling.
Really good! I wish it didn't feel like it cut off at the end. And grown Chiron didn't look like teen or child Chiron.
Hacía años que no me aburría tanto una ganadora del Oscar. Esperaba mucho más de esta película y de verdad que me decepcionó
.
Seriously, I remember now why I don't trust movies that "experts" give awards to.  This movie has no climax, a terrible ending.  Yes, the actors that play the main character are great - but the story is poorly developed.  Some characters you never hear of again....  it's just not good.  A waste of time.
Damn fine film. Excellent character study.

And very much like "We Need to Talk About Kevin" all three leads playing Moonlight's protagonist Chiron, are all note-perfect and compelling.

Not at all what you might be expecting. Very little violence. No bloodshed (unless a scratch counts.) No explicit sex (save for a few brief intimate moments, one being a dream sequence.) Just a mesmerizing glide through a young introverted man's life, dealing with a drug-using Mom at home and gay-bashing adolescents being cruel for the easy pickings of it.

A few questions left unanswered don't detract from the sheer pleasure of watching this hypnotic drama. Extremely well-crafted and ends on a note of reconciliation and no unnecessary "feel-good" contrivances. A sleeper hit and deservedly so.
Horrible movie. Should have walked out.
Jännä tarina, hyvin intensiivisesti kuvattuna. Littlen eli Chironin eli Blackin vaikea kasvutarina käydää läpi kolmessa eri osassa, joissa kuvataan kolme eri ikäkautta (lapsuus, nuoruus, aikuisuus), päähenkilöä esittää kolme eri(ikäistä) näyttelijää. Pieni Little on loistava, ja kaiken lisäksi söpö. Kerronnassa viljellään kaurismäkeläistä taiteellisuutta, hiljaisuus tehokeinona. AIna ei tarvitse puhua. Hieno elokuva, mutten ehkä jaksaisi katsoa toiseen kertaan.
If you think art should challenge us then maybe you'll embrace Barry Jenkins' nearly perfectly crafted film, Moonlight. This film is quite the accomplishment , not just for its unique narrative development , rather for its realistic qualities from its characters, themes, and environment that despite being labeled as a "gay, coming of age story" are quite universal that all empathetic individuals can get identify with. A thought provoking tale about the human condition that's a must-see! The cinematography is also out-of-sight
I liked it. I was kind of confused following the story line (but I think it's because I'm slow lol) when I caught on it felt like a love story. I didn't like how it ended, I need more closure! haha
One of the WORSE movies we've ever seen!! Its boring, depressing and badly made. I thought it would develop into something interesting but it was just a sad and poorly done movie. The subject, which was interesting and had potential was dragged out and boring. It was in fact so horrible that we had to get up and leave midmovie. And not just us!

Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!
Perfectly acted. Perfectly direction, shot, written, everything. It was legit a perfect movie. It deserved every oscar ever. Great concept, Great execution. Flawless.
Good Movie but I dont think Best Picture
Didn't really like it.
Telling a story, may be a typical one, how an African American grew up.  Not that Entertaining.  Best Picture ? Not on my list.
This movie was terrible. I was really disappointed. What a huge waste of time.
See this asap. Great movie
Mahershala Ali needs all the attention. he is so good.
It was o.k., not sure why it won the award though
overated, I don't understand all the buzz about it and still can't believe that It won best picture award, yes I agree that Ali performance was remarkable and the adult hero of the film also showed us how lonely and vulnerable he is but still I think Lala land or lion were better choice than Moonlight
Really? No, REALLY?! I walked out. It was slow, ridiculously shallow character building, no depth because there was hardly any talking. It was just trying way too hard. Us white folk, we fall for this crap. Okay with the realism - I get it. Live is hard and sucks for many, maybe most - but this movie rubs it in your face. I think being that they voted this the best picture of the year, with all those other pictures which were so much, much better, I think Hollywood has lost it. Boring! My WORST movie of the year.
Disappointing!  I made the mistake of assuming Best Picture award meant it would be worth seeing.  There's some good acting, but the storyline and script are awful.  Be forewarned, this is NOT just a movie about a young boy struggling with his identity.
Ultimately a film that doesn't really fit any of the labels you might expect going into it and I came out of it not much wiser. The crime element is always there but never a focus and it's not an obvious romance either. So much of the story happens off-screen but in a way that works. Chiron's first 3 decades are covered in snapshots and by the character's nature he's very closed off with only occasional moments of emotion escaping out. The supporting cast is where most of the emotion comes from and lucklily the entire cast is very strong. I was also impressed with how they managed to maintain the chemistry between the 3 versions of Kevin and Chiron. The only real shame is that Mahershala Ali doesn't get a much bigger part as the conflicted drug dealer who takes Chiron under his wing as the character was complex and Ali made any scene with him in shine. I'm often a bit lazy and prefer not to fill in the gaps so much with a film but this one just gets away with it.
Mahershala's role is important, if brief, and set's a quietly poignant tone in the first act.  All three incarnations of our protagonist are well executed and consistent.  And the message of this film is a lot more powerful than the mere narrative of Chiron's life.
Powerful performances and clever camera work make this a very worthy winner of 'Best Picture' which belies it's small budget. Naomie Harris is the real stand out performance.
For all the great things Moonlight did it was overshadowed by its glaring issues as a full-length feature film.

Moonlight did some really great things that will be looked back on and even studied by up and coming film students. The cinematography of Moonlight was absolutely astounding and really mirrored the character study and moods that the film portrayed. The direction of photography was also very gripping where it counted. The best thing about Moonlight is the acting, Alex Hibbert as Little Chiron was the most moving part of this film followed by Mahershala Ali as Juan the drug dealer. Both these roles were poignant and so deep that as I watched Moonlight, in the beginning, I was sure this was the best picture of 2016. Then the story played out and the character arcs fell to the sides and Moonlight truly disappointed me.

Here is my overall impression as the credits rolled, I was bored and unfulfilled. Moonlight was an interesting film as all character studies are interesting, but I felt disconnected from it. Characters I cared about were not fully fleshed out or just disappeared from the story altogether and without explanation. It's funny that this movie moves from childhood to life as a teenager to young adulthood but the story itself never fills this flow. It's disjointed and leaves the audience behind as it swiftly moves from plot point to plot point. In places where Moonlight could have soared and paid off it's very emotional story it instead switches gears and falls flat. I was so interested in the relationship Chiron had with Juan and Theresa as pseudo-parents and it never pays off or even concludes to move us forward. Instead, it brings us to a climax with Chiron's actual mother and Juan and even this scene is desperately unfulfilling.

After I saw the movie I found out it was originally a fifteen-page short story and it makes total sense that the adaptation had problems. Moonlight would have been a better short film or maybe even a pseudo-documentary. It definitely wasn't the best film of 2016 but neither was La La Land in my opinion.
It was okay, but seemed to lack connecting me truly to the character and his struggles.
Mixed feelings about this one....a good story tho.  I didn't like the ending...they leave you hanging....no pun intended.
I don't get the hype. This movie, like La La Land, is completely forgettable. If this was the best 2016 had to offer (even Suicide Squad walked away with an award), it was indeed a terrible year for movies. Every award should have been given to Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia.
With a feeling of unseen significance, Moonlight's beautiful presentation forms a brilliant experience.
Well acted and well written. It didn’t really blow me away, and I felt somewhat empty at the end. I do not think it deserved “best picture”, but worth the time to see. 
I don't understand how this was even nominated for an Oscar. Melding speech challenged child, poverty, bullying, drugs, gay and gangster together into one character is not in itself interesting. Yes, we feel sorry for children whose potential is lost due to the world being a hard place. The Academy is hopelessly self absorbed if they think voting for this movie will help. It is also extremely slow.
just a good movie. it moved me emotionally
Emotional and impacting. Even tho feels kind of empty and contains filling scenes.
An incredibly tender, nuanced and beautiful film.
Humanizes drug dealers, through their personal realization of their sexual orientation,  to a level that seems to excuse their menacing behavior. There is a disregard for how the generational cycle of poverty and violence is supported by the main character's decisions.
When I first saw the preview of this movie, I said "not interested;" however I was sucked in by the number of Oscar nominations & wins the movie received, so I decided to see what the hype was about...I should have stuck with my original thought. 

I was so bored with the storyline that I could only stand to waist 45 minutes of my life on this movie. In this 45 minutes, there was minimal dialogue, nothing but sadness, horrible music, & mediocre performances. Mind you, I did not make it past 45 minutes so the storyline could have improved; but, I have already lost time in my life that I could not regain so I decided to cut my losses and end the misery. #notallitwascrackedup2b
Beautifully shot. Amazing acting. Emotional story. Great pacing. All round an amazing movie.
Enlightening, human. Message is current and needs to be shown. Excellent cinematography.
Beautifully shot with excellent performances all around.  The ending will leave you wanting more but not in a good way.
not that good. kinda boring
There are moments of sorrow and brilliant acting but this movies lacks any true sense of excitement
Disappointment far outweighs any childhood fears created or even directed
My advice would be to turn it off before it ends with little or no sense of captivation.
Don't really know what to say and why it won the Oscar. The movie was hard to finish but the best part was I could finish it
Not only is it story telling at its finest but it's cinematic art. Also love how low budget it is. Inspiring performance by Maherahala Ali. It's a must watch.
If you're looking for a painfully boring experience with not one drop of joy or inspiration about anything memorable to take away - this one's for you. I would daresay 5 or 10 years after it won the Oscar for best picture, not many will want to see it (or remember it).  

To add salt into the wound, there was one last thing that really wanted to make me slap the director: Speaking as a food industry pro, I guess it was only a fitting piece of ridiculousness was when the cook in the diner was also (wait for it).... the waiter! And the cashier! I have my theories on how & why this movie got made (and won any awards at all).
Two stars only for techniques (Thank god for the techniques or else it would have been negative stars). The movie is beautifully crafted. The directing, detailing and actings are almost perfect. However, the whole story is incredibly draggy, and the bullying scenes just make me wanna roll my eyes. Seriously, the bullying, homosexual experience in this movie have only been put on screens 100 times before. I can see why it won awards, but by no means it's as great as people say. What is the message of this movie? And how is that different from those other 10000 indie movies out there? Yet people say La La Land is overrated and empty. The world is funny I guess.
2016's Best Picture Winner is a semi-autobiographical film that focuses on a life growing up in the most estranged places in America. A unique and investing drama that may not use real acting talents half the time though the film will explore it's setting and characters to find it's own sense of remarkable beauty, brilliantly brought to life by the directing and cinematography. When it comes to peeling back the layers of the film, Moonlight isn't all too confronting though when the pace drags and meanders it's a fascinating watch something I kinda wish I saw earlier before it's odd Best Picture Winning at the Academy Awards.
All this movie is practically perfection, I just wished I was moved by it.
Beautifully understated. A masterpiece.
This was the most boring movie I have ever seen! The directing was poor- verbal exchanges too slow- and didn't make sense! Everyone leaving the theater said the same thing. Warren Beaty's academy slip makes more sense.
Not as great as people say
This movie is so sad, the loneliness of the main character is so poignant, almost unbearable...Great performances.
Amazing! Beautiful and complex.
Terrible third act, so not deserving of a Best Picture award. Craziness.
It doesn't get better than this. What a movie!
It's not one of those action packed movies that I like, but one of those movie that the title don't catch your eye but it got awards in the oscars so I decided to check it out and it actually came out pretty interesting to see, ending sucked though.
I mean I read reviews stating this was a "life changing movie" come on now ", it was a decent film, great performances all around
I viewed this movie on the back of its Academy Awards success.
Moonlight is a simple low budget film about the growth of a south east U.S. boy, Chiron to adulthood. The film is split into three chapters. The first chapter tells the story of Chiron as a young boy, nicknamed Little.
The second chapter tells the story of Chiron in his teenage years and the third in adulthood.
The performance of the supporting cast is good. Naomie Harris (Moneypenny off the Daniel Craig Bond films) puts in a very surprising performance as Chiron's substance misuse/prostitute mother.
Basically the main story outline concerns Chiron's sexuality. A question that haunts him until adulthood.
A very average film experience if I am being honest.
Don't get me wrong not awful but not the best film of the year come on.
Of COURSE it won Best Picture...it's about confused sexuality.
That was one hard to watch movie, but good! And beautiful in its way. But somehow, when you leave the room, you need to think how happy you are to have people that love you around. Because you can never take love for granted. An Oscar as a best movie for 2016! Deserved, I think.
The first half is very moving and well done.  The characters  are rich and the direction of the film had purpose.  You really want to see where the rest goes from there.  Then it does go from there... into a strange coming of age film that turns into a bizarre, gay love story.  The first half clips right along and you can't wait to see more.  The second half drags at at a pace that makes you wish it would just end.  There are no likable characters... no one to get behind or root for, and no one you would love to hate.  It's hard to like a film without a redeeming person in it, except for the boy in the first part of the movie.
very disappointed. slow moving.  Not what I would pick as a "Movie of the Year"
portrayal of the moments, people, and unknowable forces that shape our lives and make us who we are.
Over-rated, slow and drags abit. Some great performances like Merhashala Ali and Trevante Rhodes made it worth watching
Unreal storytelling. Because it's so real you will weep. 100% worth the hype and accolades.
Was ok at best, Oscar,?, please. Was very slow, almost painful to watch
Do I think it deserves Best Picture? No. Is it still a good movie? Absolutely! While I don't think it's a masterpiece due to the slow first act and a completely nonsensical and one-sided incident at the end of the second act, the third act alone makes it worth watching. There are better films out there, but this one still has plenty of merits to make up for the flaws.
Honestly?  It was OK, but Best Picture of the year?   A Man Called Ove was  a far more compelling and interesting story. (although only nominated for best foreign),  In any case Hidden Figures should have won Best Picture, a fascinating, important, true story.
Emotional, but seemed a little forced.
5 out of 5 Stars

Having not seen this before the Oscars I selected La La Land for best picture.  Having just watched this....now, I'm not so sure.  I loved La La Land but this film...it's unique...and excellent..and something that Maritha and I both commented that you rarely if ever see on the screen.  It's heartbreaking to watch.  I'm sure that there are some, probably many, who can relate to the trajectory of the character in this movie.  There are universally relateable themes...trying to find oneself, afraid to follow your true path, not fitting in but...presented from a unique angle.  I won't go more into it but it's well worth a watch.

 The performances are solid...all of them.  An excellent cast.   Since the film goes from a young boy, to teenager, to young adult you see the character in different periods of his life and all of the actors portraying were outstanding.  

I think that Mahershala Ali who won best supporting actor would not have been my choice...not that his performance wasn't excellent but I just found Michael Shannon in Nocturnal Animals stronger.  However, Moonlight was a stronger film so...there you go.

See this film...it's unique.
What a terrible depressing movie. I can't believe it won an Oscar. Not oscar worthy
A crucial mistake was made for casting one of the main characters. 
The rest of the movie speaks for itself.
I can't believe people gave this movie a great review..
I see why it won an award ????
Watched this seeing the Academy Awards. Quite disappointed. Poor acting, dialogue, and plot. I was quite bored by it - I kept on wanting to fast forward. I assume the award was for the underlying social issues addressed.
Compelling and supremely well acted. Stays with you
4.2/5

Moonlight is not only a product of its time in the sociopolitical sense, but it is also a film that exemplifies the advancements made in cannes-style cinematography and dramatic narration, which is both its biggest accomplishment as well as its biggest shackle, rendering the film a step forward, but hardly a revolution of any kind.
I can't help but think due the african American backlash over the past few years that the USA film academy is just paying lip service to them and the gay community by giving this best picture. It may address issues that haven't been seen by joe public before, but it was so slow and as the credits rolled I was still awaiting the punch line.
Story about a young boy who's mother dies from drugs and he grows up to be a drug dealer. The end...
Where's the story??? 
Clearly the fact that he was gay makes it ok to be a drug dealer.
Only extreme lefts would give this movie any indication of thumb up. To use the race/gender card to give an Oscar is pathetic.
Így vonul egy örökké rugdalt, megalázott ember szépen, lassan élethosszig tartó érzelmi defenzívába. Hosszú id? után végre megint egy radikális filmnél az Oscar.
Started off good, but took a turn for the weird and awful.
Good movie, the kid is great in it.  Touching in parts.  Not so sure about best picture oscar though
I am at a loss to understand all the critical acclaim received by this movie.   It's as if Hollywood is trying to make up for the criticism it received for not having any black actors nominated last year.  This film had so much potential but stopped short at every turn when it should have gotten grittier and dug deeper into the storyline.   I watched this at home and was thankful for my fast forward button since the film moved at slower than a snail's pace.  I didn't hate it, just wanted more and it continued to deliver less.   I felt it safely skirted around the topics it introduced when it should have explored them in more depth and at a quicker pace.
Best picture of not only the year, but the decade. The film left me feeling certain emotions for days after. Amazing film with a message that society desperately needs to hear.
Beautiful movie, soundtrack & score-a work of art! EXCELLENT acting! I'm glad this was made because in black & latino communities being gay is downplayed, ridiculed & frowned upon so thank you, Mr. Jenkins, for confirming that it's OK to be gay! I'm SO glad this film got the Oscar, well-deserved! I hate the fact that their moment to shine (acceptance speech) was horrible ruined by this atrocious Oscar committee -a damn DISGRACE on their part! In conclusion, this movie is a must see. I HIGHLY recommend to mature-minded, sophisticated people.
I enjoy classic coming-of-age tales. These sorts of stories are often heartwarming and touching without feeling too sentimental, and offer a clear process of growth for the protagonist which is easy to latch onto. "Moonlight" has the framing of a coming-of-age tale, but it isn't a traditional one. It's more about metamorphosis than growing up, and while the movie employs a tight narrative focus on its main character, it's as much about the general as it is about the psychological.

The movie is based on a previously unpublished play "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue" by Tarell Alvin McCraney, adapted by director Barry Jenkins himself. Both men were relative unknowns before this, and the premise of "Moonlight" as a piece of queer black cinema makes it a wonder it ever got made. Let alone win three Academy Awards, including best film.

The first act, titled "Little," opens with a perfect sequence where fast, dynamic handheld camerawork draws us into the story. That camera follows Juan, a drug dealer inspecting his streets. From off-hand dialogue we find out that this is Miami 1980, just after the race riots set in motion by the acquittal of four police officers who killed an arrested black man. Juan's pose- portrayed perfectly by Mahershala Ali- is calm but weary; he seems immediately aware of the transitory nature of his day-to-day survival.

Juan notices a young boy being chased by bullies hide himself in an abandoned building. Here we have our protagonist, a boy named Chiron (Alex Hibbert, with a presence far exceeding his years). Juan follows the boy, takes him home to his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monáe) and feeds him. The next day Juan takes Chiron to a sunny beach, teaches him how to swim and tells him to never let anyone define him. Juan helps Chiron own the belittling name "Little" from the schoolyard. A new family of sorts is formed.

Juan keeps on dealing drugs, and Chiron's nurse mother Paula (Naomie Harris, viciously talented) keeps using them, Chiron is aware of the connection. Responsibility clashes with perceived necessity. In one scene Juan scolds Paula for using, Paula Juan for selling; jealousy and feelings of guilt surround Chiron from all sides. Among children he is an outsider, constantly threatened, friends with only one boy Kevin (Jaden Piner).

In a momentous yet subtle scene Chiron asks Juan what "Faggot" means. The conversation connects with the previous argument between Juan and Paula. They have both realized that for all the hardships Chiron faces as a black boy from a poor background he will experience sorrows of more private kinds as well.

The second act is titled "Chiron". Fittingly prosaic, as he is now in his teens, a time when childhood gives way to fragile proto-adult identity. Chiron, now played in an intensely wary manner by wonderful Ashton Sanders, is still a complete outsider at school, viciously bullied by Terrel (Patrick DeCile) and his gang. Home is as bad as school. Paula has sunk deeper into addiction, punishing her son for her lost life. Juan is dead, with only Teresa still there to keep Chiron afloat.

Most of the act is set in Chiron's school. By this point it becomes inescapably clear how predefined the life Chiron can ever have is. This is the America you rarely see in movies, the America where people aren't even bothered to be angry anymore, an America where opportunities are fairytale, something no one real has ever had.

As a film of 2016, "Moonlight" invites to find similes between now and the time it is set in. It subtly invokes images from police brutality videos that shock us, and the accompanying statistics that enrage us. But the immediate focus is still on the psychological, the immediacy of the school corridors where oppression isn't imposed by law but by the demands of masculinity. There, hierarchy is broken by Kevin (now Jharrel Jerome), popular and cheeky. Kevin dares to have a connection with Chiron, who he has begun calling "Black". The two boys share an intimate moment turned sexual encounter on the same beach Juan taught Chiron to swim. The scene is beautiful, a flicker of a dream among the cruel reality of Chiron's existence.

In a progression so like in a classic Greek tragedy, intimacy and social dissidence is punished by Terrel, who senses the forbidden connection between segregated levels of the school social order. At this point- the transition between acts two and three- it feels for a moment that the plot might fall apart. But by now the movie has transformed from a realistic deconstruction into an entity of symbolic dimensions. The visual style of the second act backs this up and sequential, some might say formulaic events become representations, accentuating the fatalistic hold a community has on the individual. Jenkins finds a careful balance with fleshed-out, urgently identifiable characters and highly representative events. And never once does he let us feel superior pity while painful compassion abounds.

The final, triptych completing act bears the name Kevin gave Chiron. "Black" has been transformed by example into a drug dealer, muscular and restrained, played by Trevante Rhodes. The theme of metamorphoses solidifies here. The transition from "Little" to "Chiron" was subtle, but the third act offers a dramatic change both in stylistic tone and in Chiron's character. He has survived as the only identity he ever had the hope of surviving in, as a thug. He still shields himself, behind gold dentures among other things.

Paula has recovered from addiction, but is lost to her son who still sees in her the broken, hateful mother. They have a reunion scene that communicates volumes. Harris never allows Paula to become a dark stereotype of a drug addict and here she shows baffling depth to her character and lets the audience see humanity Chiron no longer can.

As a grand finale, Jenkins channels Won Kar-wai in another reunion sequence, bound to become an integral part of movie history. This reunion is set mostly in a dinery at nighttime, and is between Chiron and Kevin (now André Holland). Here the harsh streets of the first act have completely given way to the glow of streetlights on wet asphalt, the hot night has transformed from a dangerous predator into a realm of beauty where you remain in long after the end titles have faded. Thus, "Moonlight" carries us through the essential forms of cinematic dimensions from relevant realism to magic, organically, as only a masterpiece can.
The movie does an impressive job of bringing these three actors together into one convincing performance.  It's a very human, truthful and sad story.
Absolutely mesmerising.
How on earth did this win best picture? Its an average film at best with Naomi Harris as the only standout performance.
Overrated, didn't deserve to win the Oscar Best Picture. But, because of "Oscars so white", they had to please the African Americans. SAD.
Boring. Worst movie that ever won an award
Pathetic leftist propaganda to encourage LGBT and diversity. NOT recommended for children to watch this crap!
Interesting, emotional, different.  By different, I mean you have this mix of two seemingly totally different genres:  the growing up in the hood drama and the growing up gay drama.  But obviously real life does not fit into preconceived, mutually exclusive genres so it's refreshing that such a movie exists.  I also like the nearly novelistic take on the main character's life.
"Moonlight" is captivating, poignant, disturbing, ugly, beautiful -- and most of all, "Moonlight" is radiant.  With excellent acting and superb directing, "Moonlight" tells a tale of human identity emerging from a world steeped in vulnerability, fear, isolation and the cycles of abuse visited most harshly upon oppressed communities.  It's is a thoughtful work of art well worth seeing.
A coming of age story from a perspective never seen in film.
I generally agree with either the Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster user score, but not with this movie.

The character development in this movie will confuse you. Additionally there is a weird blurry filter used in the first half of the film that is distracting.
OK this movie made me dizzy... and I was thinking... Is this really a great movie?! YES! when I saw ending! Writer/Director Barry Jenkins made a strange, moving, unique and extraordinary movie. Climax was unexpected, bitter sweet and wonderful. Main character is lonely and quiet boy Chiron, his mother's drug addict and his life was terrible. But he seeks his own happiness... Oscar winner Mahershala Ali's performance was great, but he appeared in the movie for only few minutes! Oscar nominee Naomi Harris was fantastic. Janelle Monae was nice too. Maybe some people didn't like it, because Chiron's very uncomfortable sexuality... But I thought that's why movie was one of a kind. Brad Pitt did Co-Executive Producer.
Propaganda piece. Formulaic and nothing new here; playing to the poisonous identity politics of the day. Hollywood and movie critics detach further from the realm of reality.
Mahershala Ali (a long time personal favorite for work in 4400, House of Cards, Treme), manages to stand out strongly in his brief time in the film. Other extraordinary performances compliment one of the most moving, personal, and remarkably human scripts in years. The cinematography only perfects the beautiful film landscape.
quite boring.  Much better to see Hidden Figures or Lion
Moonlight is an intimate heartfelt story that doesn't quite fit the mold, which makes it unique and a really great movie experience.
A unique movie that has layers of drama and depth yet told in a stunning visual and simple way. With fantastic, subtle performances, our main character takes centre stage as is right for this type of movie as people of all types and backgrounds can relate to this touching yet real film.
One of the worst movies I've seen. I cannot believe this movie won Best Picture.
What's frustrating to me about Moonlight is that the director seems to think I will automatically care about his character - indeed there's only one character in this movie - and therefore makes no effort to build a story that might make me care about The One and Only Character. This is a dangerous strategy, and for me it backfired entirely. I didn't care, I don't care, I won't care. No story? No caring. That's my negotiation with movies. The ten year old version of The Character didn't have it figured out, the teenager didn't have it figured out, and the adult didn't have it figured out.  And I can't figure out why I paid twelve bucks for this go-nowhere film.
Great overall movie even though Oscar winning movies never win me over this was pretty good.
The scenes were well shot  but the overall story left gaps and didnt go anywhere. Dissatisfied.
This is a good movie. It's very drawn, and I think that's because it's giving the audience moments to feel. That said, I was left wanting at the end.
Um filme que chega muito próximo da perfeição técnica. Com uma história muito humana e válida. Cheia de personagens extremamente complexos e vivos. Oscar justo... (não que pra La la land não seria...)
Garbage!! I can't believe this stupid movie has won an Oscar for best movie. i can see now it's all politics and the academy being scare of being sued or criticised by the LGBT community.
"Moonlight is one of the best movies that I've ever seen when it comes to depicting a true, very difficult and harsh environment growing up. With a perfect (all black!) cast and a great story involving every stereotype that today's society (unfortunately) still despises, Barry Jenkins has a pitch-perfect achievement in directing this movie and its story is heartbreakingly and emotionally transmitted to the audience"

Rating: A+
wow what a shame 
a far cry from a great movie only thing I can think of is Hollywood is dead in Europe and North America so they are playing to 3rd world nation trying to get ratings back
Great movie, so glad it won!!
Bem melhor que Lalaland
How people can't see through propaganda indoctrination attempts... is beyond me
Una película aburridisima , con una historia pobre ,no aporta nada de nada en 6 meses pasa al olvido fácilmente.
Best movie of the year. No contest.
Offered good insight into a world that many don't know too much about. A little dry at the end, but overall, good movie
Pretentious, too much music, too many pauses
The worst movie of the year
While this movie is important and incredibly well done, it left me wanting more overall and emotionally
A deep and well structured drama brought in a very comprehensive way which will induce epiphany and sonder for whom's watching.
This movie is so deep
Not just slow it's glacial!
Overestimated film...
I was excited to see this movie after seeing the trailer, reading glowing reviews and a particularly great interview with the director and actors on CBS News Sunday Morning. The problem was that the interview gave away the entire plot of the film because the plot was paper thin. This is the first A24 movie that has ever disappointed me. The incredible acting and amazing cinematography were wasted on a crappy script. Act 3 felt particularly sloppy to me. I felt like the most interesting part of the main character's development happened entirely off screen between Act 2 and Act 3. The fact that it won Best Adapted Screenplay is beyond insulting. A movie shouldn't win awards based on it's social importance if that movie fails to deliver. If I were rating the movie based on how much I enjoyed it, I would have given it 1/2 star. However, the acting and cinematography was damn near perfect. The sound mixing was the worst of any recent movie. There's a scene in Act 3 where Chiron is talking to his mom and there's a damn bird squawking so loud through the scene that I could barely focus on the dialogue. I refuse to enthusiastically support a movie just because it supports my social and political beliefs. Maybe I just expected too much of this film.
Unoriginal, uninspired, boring and simplistic. It made $22 million on limited release for a reason. I can't believe this rubbish won best picture over La La Land. One of the greatest film tragedies of all time. Oh well, I guess that's politics for ya!
It's not a good start when a film makes you dizzy. Moonlight has honestly one of the worst cameraworks, Blair Witch Project probably was more tolerable. The story is not really deepy or complex, but rather it looks at the hypocrisy of characters in our lives and how they shaped us. The movie touched on many of the social taboos though it didn't offer any positive solution to the issues faced by the characters, in fact violence as promoted as the solution. While I appreciate the raw acting, it is nowhere remarkable or enticing to view Moonlight.
Young man's struggle to find himself, reminds me a lot of "Childhood" but with more drama that touches race and sexuality, which I think it was the main reason for winning the Oscar.
Interesting film. Pretty much a story spanning across a person's life. In this person's life they struggled with bullies as a kid and other circumstances. It shaped who the person became apparently. 

Not entirely a thought provoking film. Not really a feel good film either. Simply a perspective film of a human being. Sheds light on people in life that potentially relate to them. 

Regardless in life the one golden rule that sort of matters is this. Usually everyone in life is undergoing some battle that is none of anybody's business. If they make it somebodys business then that's on them and a whole other can of worms. However put simply again, life isn't a breeze unless you have a billion dollars. Even then, it isn't breezy as people desire your billion dollars. Human beings are at the top of the food chain. We have evolved as our own prey and demise. With that stated humans always find bullshit ways to cause conflict. In respect to this film, it is simply the still prevalent racial and perhaps other identity conflicts in society. 

It is just very hard but possible to move past prejudices in society. Unfortunately sometimes media can be used in a bad way of hammering the point continually, but yet is good. The Oscars snafu was staged and there's more than meets the eye there. It's a tv show with a ton of actors... Regardless at least they are using their platform to bring attention to a film that isn't really that bad to watch. Has a significant purpose as a film, and at minimum provides insight into a perspective of some human beings.
A triumph for the politically correct. ..numbingly boring!
Beyobd unbelievable that this could win Best Picture, as it probably the worst film
I have ever seen!  If you want to see the Worst Picture of the year, this is the film for you!
Unique story, told in three chapters of the main characters life. **Semi-spoiler alert** I wanted more Mahershala Ali, he was terrific, but surprised he won best supporting actor awards when he was only in the first 1/3 of the movie. I liked each chapter less as the story progressed and the ending was way too abrupt, left me like the Nick Young "??" meme.
While the themes and the messages are excellenty thought-out, the execution is somewhat flawed, particularly when talking character and feeling. But even those mistakes can be forgiven because of the importance of the movie, and they don't prevent Moonlight from being a great watch and a somewhat essential piece of cinema
A technical masterpiece that is halted by its slow moving plot. Visually, this is a phenomenal film, and the acting is absolutely incredible. Ali gives a great performance, if only for a portion of the film. The message the film wants to send you is sometimes lost in the transition between parts for the main character, I felt like each part skipped way to much time in between, especially the between the second and third act. It was more of a personal problem, but I have to admit despite my frustration, I thought the transitions were handled well enough. I also had a more difficult time relating to the main character due to his sullenness, it wasn't that I didn't understand why he was that way, I just had a hard time relating to him because of it. Overall, this was a very good film, but certain smaller issues rubbed against me, and I felt it could've been written better in terms of the three acts. I didn't feel like it was necessary for such large time jumps
Currently tied for favourite film of 2017 with La La Land
Certainly, a very real commentary on life without a mother., bullying, and sexuality . Honestly, Law and Order SVU episodes have illicited much more raw emotion than this movie did.  Just like the main character in Manchester by the Sea, both leading roles have a totally flat affect.
This is more of a story about growing up rather than one merely about African-americnas and gays. It deserves BP of Academy Awards.
Beautifully shot and emotionally raw, Moonlight tells a story that is as sensitive to our modern landscape as it a timeless social commentary. It is a story, told in three parts, about a young, black man growing up in the midst of confusion (of the pain of life, his sexuality, and the meaning of love).  

In terms of the theme of the young man's struggle with sexuality, it is told with surprising constraint, with greater attention given to his relationship to the world around him (and his inner struggles playing into that). In terms of the sheer pain that he carries, the film allows that to slowly unravel through the use of colour, textures, tone, silence and the odd emotional burst. 

I found Moonlight to be much more blatant in its hopeful nature than the much more nuanced undercurrents of Manchester By the Sea, even if the two are similar types of films that really dig underneath of the surface of some incredibly tough themes. This is what allows, for example, the mother in the third act to make such an immediate turn around from the dire place we last see her. Without the films positive outlook, I think our ability to see her character as anything other than vile and unforgivable would be greatly challenged, but as it is, the affect of the film in allowing us to see the characters as more than just the brokenness and the hurt arrives by slowly encouraging our ability to forgive as we watch the films main character seem to forgive the impossible in his own life. 

I will admit, I wasn't overwhelmed by this film, at least not in the same way as Manchester. It took me a bit to get over the fact that they play three different actors for the same character who look nothing alike. And there are points where I felt the dramatic scenes were slightly overplayed for the affect of what becomes a rather frustrating and persisting silence (of someone who has been left with very few words). But it would take a hard heart indeed not to be won over by the films honesty. And thematically, the film really does work as a multi-faced commentary on what it means to find yourself alone, to face rejection in home and at school, and to struggle with the expectations and stereotypes of masculinity.
Atmospheric and beautifully done. Masterful performances. Didn't need to figure out what they were saying.
I really thought this was going to be good and it almost was but it really just built itself up and went no where it could have been so much more with a better ending it's worth the watch but a hell of a let down.
The talent of the cast and director is evident but, still, I couldn't help but feel I was bludgeoned over the head with pathos while Barry Jenkins repeatedly states to the audience "Feel sorry for Chiron! Feel sorry for Chiron!...Do you feel sorry for Chiron yet?"
A movie that feels very real.
Was so disappointed in this film. What was the point? They made it quickly and it shows.
Rating it higher just because it's colored is also discrimination. This is unfair.
Other than some major scenes...it's quite boooring. Good acting, but booooring.
I went to see this because of all the rave reviews.  But personally, I found it disappointing.  I could not relate to this movie at all, maybe because I am a straight, white, middle-class woman.  It was disjointed and depressing beyond words.  Obviously, I am missing something here since the rest of the world has gone ga-ga over it.
It succeeds by being pretty much unique in its cool portrayal of a topic rarely treated this way, it has many tender moments of varying degrees, and is all beautifully filmed. However, it offers no glimmer of real hope or optimism, and utterly fails to address the betrayal so brutally thrown in front of us - as though making a hard life look good is enough. Almost every scene, on its own, is excellent, but the story they tell together is stereotyped and very problematic. And there's some very over done shaky-cam close-up footage.
Pure art and emotion
One of the best movies I've seen. A cinematic masterpiece with performances unlike any other.
Teach me  ! I'd love to learn to film a screenplay filmmakers did here. My fan boy self only goes three stars I feel tho. I saw impressive work adapting Tarell Alvin McCraney's play into a film,  rearranging the structure into a more linear story and allowing relatively sparse dialogue create drama. I think the voters felt the emotional impact on this film as well-the right in the feelsss. And I believe it won Oscar gold!  I'm saying shout out to the cast and crew especially the new faces who carried large roles, you know?...deep bow. I'l do another round very soon.
By? mo?e nie jest to film dla wszystkich, ze wzgl?du na form?, powolne t?po i tematyk?, jednak mnie przeszy? na wskro?. Produkcja niezwykle wa?na, tym bardziej w dzisiejszym ?wiecie, tak mocno przecie? przepe?nionym nietolerancj?. Do tego wspania?e zdj?cia, poruszaj?ca muzyka a przede wszystkim wielkie, w swojej pozornej prostocie, aktorstwo. Wyj?tkowy film, dla tych bardziej wra?liwych kinomanów umiej?cych czyta? mi?dzy wierszami.
Absolutely phenomenal film. Incredibly touching, emotional, and real. Tugs at your heartstrings the whole way through. This difficult and powerful story is told so eloquently and beautifully. It's a MUST SEE. Absolutely deserving of the best picture award. Incredible.
Didn't get it. The only best picture nominated film that I felt was a waste of time after watching it.
I watched this because it won an Oscar but it turned out to be one of the worst films I have ever sat through.

The story is very weak and the dialogue ponderous and boring.

Definitely one to miss. No wonder it was not given any awards by BAFTA
A story that's been told many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYot1WjpB-s
Interesting. A film about life. Not sugar-coated. Not much to say. If this is best picture then La La Land can't be all that.
the rare time the academy got it right. tough to watch but important to watch as well.
I saw this movie before the Holidays.  When I saw it I was the only one in the theater watching this thing.  No joke, the only person. Never in my wildest dreams would have ever thought it would win best picture, and the other oscars  it did.
Look the movie is good.   But Best Picture?  Come on.  This is a typical run of the mill Indy film.   People like me who watch everything including the bowels of the indy film world were not surprised by anything we saw in this film.
I think what hurts the most about it winning best picture will be a film that was held in pretty good regard will now be torn apart and labeled overrated, because of the "Best Picture" award.    Sad.  Because the people that actually took the time to watch this movie before "media" told us it was a masterpiece will be forgotten and left to defend a movie that had no business of ever being "top dog, best picture".    So what am supposed to say to people when they ask if it was worthy of best picture.  I will be honest and say NO.
Politics aside of why it won.  I am just sad this good indy film will be torn apart now.
Anyway.   shout out to all of use who actually saw this thing before we were told to go see it.   :-)
Peace.
One word comes to mind when watching this movie.... And that word is "TRASH!!!!"
It was legit one of dumbest and most boring movie I've ever had to sit through, it did not deserve any of the oscars it got at all.

P.S 
I really wish I didn't have to give this film a half star rating, cause it didn't even deserve that.
this one cuts deep. STUNNING! well deserved golden statue.
Not many can stomach it, I'm sure. Yet, so many live it, experience it every day. I can see why it won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
Are you kidding me , Best Picture???
Slow, average acting and the star hardly talks!
I don't know what people are smoking when they give this movie such high marks 
Has anyone seen the movies: Lion, Elle, and Hacksaw Ridge??
Granted I can't stand Mel Gibson as a person.
But as a Director he did a brilliant job with Hacksaw Ridge and voters need to separate the person from the artistic production.
And why should the young lead actor who played a medic and conscientious objector be denied an award for Best Actor, because people hate Mel Gibson?
Lion was a great picture and the Golden Globes recognized Elle and Isabelle Huppert for her superb acting and best foreign language film
It's a shame what the expanded Academy ( hundred of new voters added since last year's Oscars So White) has descended into!
Borrowing, self serving nonsense
An intimate portrayal of an identity struggle.
One of the most remarkable films of the year,  made with a low budget, with astounding performances from Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris and its three moments highlight the script on which it was based on. It is a moving story which should get people away from prejudice. Lovely!
A coming of age story which tells the story of a young homosexual boy going through three tough stages in his life. The progression from a bullied and abused adolescent who was looked down upon by society and his own parents, turns into a secluded, strong man who shares a strong bond with his friend. Moonlight is an impressively constructed and written film which explores the themes of homosexuality in African-American culture, and is worthy to receive "Best Picture" at the Academy Awards.
What a crap, boring movie.
Great movie! The story was beautiful and the acting was almost superb. The ending, however, was kinda so-so. I was hoping for something more. Solid 4 stars.
more than an experience
'Moonlight' manages to tell the story of a Chiron, a boy growing up queer, and black, in a single-parent household, in a city reeling from neglect - without once falling into cliche. 

This film is not an easy viewing experience, but it manages to be redemptive in spite of the painful events that unfold. And it profoundly adds to our conversations about identity and community, with a deft touch. 

I hope that the Best Picture fiasco at the Oscars means that more people would watch this grossly underappreciated film.
Nothing clever to say here. This is a great movie. A meaningful and honest movie. Both brutal and beautiful. Watch it. Just watch it.
gripping, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking narrative. beautiful and groundbreaking technique, for the most part. a nearly perfect film, fitting for the late 2010s. certainly revolutionary for mainstream film.
Poignant and effortless, Moonlight is less about plot than it is about the little things which make up one's life, be it teaching a young boy how to swim, an extended conversation in a quiet diner, or a midnight rendezvous at the beach. It's one of the best films in recent memory. For fans of Frank Ocean and Atlanta.
I'm giving it a one to help reduce its rating. A 5 no way, probably a 3.5 movie. I saw it and was like ehhh. Better to watch it on ppv or on demand.
This film includes great direction, scoring and cinematography, and stand out performances by Naomi Harris and Ashton Sanders. Despite all of that, and it's relevant and "important" subject matter, it is still the movie equivalent of Rohypnol and left no impression on me at all. The bullying scenes were a little too "after-school special" and fake, and its snail-like pace really tests the audience. This film will get faux love, genuine love, faux criticism and genuine criticism, so it may be hard to determine if you should go see it. I say, unless you have a particular interest, save your time and money.
Great acting and a remarkable story. 

4.5/5 = Must See
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything is way too drawn out and slow, and the ending has no conclusion to any problems the movie presents. I think it was only rated so highly because of political correctness.
Great movie, would have liked to have seen a little more about the transition from high school to the end of the movie.
Both deeply personal and exceptional. Loved the pacing, the photography, and its universal truth. The third act was my favorite.
Both deeply personal and exceptional, this film captures a perspective we rarely get to see. I loved everything about it from the pacing, the photography, and its universal truth. The third act was my favorite.
I love the way this movie represents the transition between a child and a desolated man.
Moonlight >La La Land
Good but not as good as everyone says it is
demasiado comercial, ...muito cor de rosa com  o indispensável  happy ending"
Filled with great acting, a beautiful photography and an important message, this film is pretty great, but I expected more from it. Maybe it's because the story is so particular (the main character is a poor african american gay man that lives in a drugs-filled part of Miami) that I couldn't relate so much with it and, therefore, couldn't love it as much as I loved Boyhood or La La Land. It is an important film, definetly, but it's not one that I loved. But I do praise the performances, especially by Naomi Harris and Mahershala Ali, and the reflections about identity it has. It is definetly not a bad film, but I just expected so much more from it.
Deceivingly quiet yet immensely powerful. Otherworldly (to me) yet immediately relatable. An emotionally intimate portrait of the universal struggle to find and accept emotional intimacy. Moonlight is all things and more in a film that immediately commands your attention from the opening scene through to its closing frames. *applause*
I'll admit it, going in to see the film, I had a preconceived notion that this film was simply going to fetish-ize gay, black love, make it sexy and beautiful as added arsenal to the liberal agenda. Well, it did all that, plus a whole lot more.

Moonlight tells the universal story of a young man trying to find his
place in the world. This particular young man had a few extra hurdles
to face growing up which I can relate to, and can tell from some of the
other reviewers that they did not; they were blessed enough to grow up in a safe, supportive environment and just do not get this movie and never will.

The story is gritty in its realness of hostile school environments and
the devastating effect of drugs on the ability of adults to nurture and
guide their children. Yet the story is also beautiful, in it's
characters' relationships - it tells the truth about the unique
"blended" families in the black community, where it's not just about
blood, but also who looks out for you in this cold, cold world.

People are knocking the third act but it was my favorite. About 10
minutes into the diner scene, I realize we're still there, and there's
no rush to leave and I admire that realistic view for once. It's rare
that films will linger in such a manner, bringing you into the scene
and having it encompass you like you are there, nice and slow, to be enjoyed like a multi-course, fine dining meal. Instead we are often "treated" to fast food movies, jumping from one scene to the next, just staying in one scene long enough to move the plot line along, as if in a race. If there is a race, Moonlight is the tortoise against all the other hares and wins the race.

Some may call this movie a chick flick for gay men, but I think this
film is an intimate, 20-page love letter to anyone living with
self-doubt, pain, uncertainty, and the fear of being themselves. It is
truly a gem.
I don't get the hype. Despite the likelihood that it will win the Oscar for adapted screenplay; I don't think it is very well written. Could not connect with characters.
Blue is the warmest colour.

This is an exceptional film, but only from one perspective and that is, LGBT. I totally respect that, because I'm a big supporter. But apart from that, particularly from the filmmaking aspect I did not like it. I felt like this film took place somewhere in Africa, but the accent was American. Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background.

The happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative.

More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best.

7/10
Overrated. I didn't care for it. Very well acted, but poorly edited. Hard to follow. The main character kept changing too much in appearance at different ages.
I am not just reviewing this movie because it won the Oscar a few weeks ago, even if that is one reason. "Moonlight" is a wonderful film that is a coming of age story about an African-American man who is bullied for being gay. It is hard to describe the plot in a sentence or two, but I can tell you the movie is told in three different parts, one as a kid, teen and a grown man. The boy's name is Chiron, and his mother(like many at the time) was a crack-addict and would never give Chiron the love he needed. Chiron, as a young boy, met a friendly drug dealer and his girlfriend, who are the only ones sharing affection with him. The dealer, Juan, and his girlfriend take care of him by feeding him, and letting him spend the night on occasions. As he grows up, Chiron gets bullied even more, and it almost seems as everything gets worse. Having trouble with his identity, he meets a troublemaker named Kevin who actually has feelings for him, and they experience sexuality. But of course, there are always more conflicts for him to experience. When a grown man, he becomes someone else, not who the real, "little" Chiron is. "Moonlight" is a hard movie to watch at many parts, including the second act. It is also hard to relate to these characters, bullied, black, gay and surrounded by drugs. The real reason why this movie is so emotional, so captivating is because of the incredible performances by ALL, and the WONDERFUL directing from Barry Jenkins. I left this movie crying, because at the end it's almost like a fill in the blank, you have to understand from what Chiron has gone through, and how he turns out. Many people dislike this movie, to be mean towards black people, and I assure you, if no one told me or you this had an all-black cast, you wouldn't notice. Rated R.
From all the hype this movie got leading up to and after the Academy Awards, I expected more. The subject matter is interesting and the acting is good, but the pace of the movie is far too slow.

I found myself drifting and losing interest during the movie a few times and was getting frustrated at the lack of dialogue from the main character.
The tough life of a poor black gay kid, with the misfortune to grow up where there's no middle class to rescue him.  They don't have a Dead Poets' Society at his deadbeat school.  Nobody has ever taken him to a show; no inspiring teacher with That Special Insight has ever suggested that he read The Symposium.  Most gay coming of age movies resolve into these class cliches (but all struggle is class struggle, is it not?), and it is almost refreshing to to find one that clearly has no intention of doing so.  Though, in the end, being trapped in this depressing drug-infested milieu (where the depth of field is very shallow and almost everything out of focus), our hero is doomed, it seems, to endure the longest dry spell in cinema history.  This triptych depicts life in a sexual desert - with very severe myopia to boot.  Brilliant performances from all; though many will regret the lack of subtitles - best wait for the DVD.
The front runner for me so far.
This movie is absolute perfection, a piece of art our world desperately needs.
Simple yet powerful. It addresses many social issues and peer influences in a beautifully made and narrated film.
I had mixed feelings about this film. Although the story was important to be told, I didn't like the negative surroundings -- drug dealers, crack head mom -- for me it just took something away from the message. With that said, the acting was great.
I don't know what's wrong with me.... I just didn't find this very compelling, despite the lavish praise from everyone else.  I also feel like I've seen this story before - in fact I saw something very similar less than a year ago.  Also, I fear I might be losing my affection for film as a storytelling medium.  It's starting to bore me.
For an Oscar nomination, this film is quite weak. We got it that Chiron is a brooding gay man, struggling in his hood. But it's just that, it doesn't carry any development or a big revelation about whether he's at peace with himself.
"Moonlight' was easily one of the slowest most un thought provoking Films of the year. But in saying this "Moonlight" did have some nice character moments, especially in the first half. The Plot to "Moonlight" is A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighbourhood of Miami. The Direction by "Barry Jenkins" I found to be very choppy at times by having no idea what he wanted to do with what he had. I could tell by watching the film (especially in the second half) that he didn't know how to show these characters as being likeable, had no idea how to skip time periods and didn't know what to put in the final cut of the film and what not to put in. Which brings me onto the editing. The editing in this film I found super hard to keep up with and is one of the main reasons there where so many plot holes. The Acting in this I found to be really good, one of the only great things about this film in my opinion. The main standouts for me where "Mahershala Ali" and "Janelle Monáe". Even though these two actors had minimal time on screen they made the most of their screen time and where super believable. The Characters in this film where all over the place. The main protagonist being Alex who you see grow on screen. This character I found to be very annoying at times and then slightly likeable at other times. The character that I thought was the most believable and likable was Teresa, this is mainly caused by "Janelle Monáe" doing a great job in her role but the screenplay also helped as well. Speaking of the screenplay, I found it to be atrociously written at many points. With some major plot holes and not knowing what happened to many characters one main example being Juan. The Score composed by "Nicholas Britell" was exceptionally composed and worked perfectly with the film. One of the biggest issues I had with "Moonlight" was the pacing. The pacing had huge issues with it being way too slow in the second half. I'm majorly surprised I made it through the whole film. The first half of the film had an okay, it was still slow at times but it was watchable. But once it got into the third act, the film just put on its brakes and went to a full on halt. Although one scene I did like from the film was when the main protagonist Alex was with a supporting character Juan at a beach and Juan was teaching Alex to swim. I found that scene to have a big impact on the character and moved the story along well. Overall I found "Moonlight" to have some good character moments, excellent acting from two supporting roles "Mahershala Ali" and "Janelle Monáe", and an excellent score that went perfectly with the film. Although it did have major issues with the pacing in the second half, chopping directing, a few annoying characters, a screenplay that was horribly written and horrific editing. I give 2016's "Moonlight" a 5/10.
Good movie.  I really thought the cast was perfect for all three stages of his life.  Very touching and at times, gut wrenching story.  It was put together nicely and with a different touch.
Beautifully directed, beautifully written, good acting, original story. Nice watch
Well done in all aspects, characters were well played out and acted.
A brilliant film dissecting the complicated experience at the intersection of race, gender, and sexual orientation, Barry Jenkins gives us a film that is not only beautiful to watch but is so very important in this day and age.

There are many films that rely on an ensemble cast, but Moonlight is an example where the removal of any one actor or character from the film causes the script to fall apart at the seams. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are more than deserving of their accolades, but the three Chirons, Janelle Monae, and the rest are all just as deserving. 

At a tight 110 minute runtime, Moonlight moves with confidence, giving the audience just enough of each scene to deliver the intended impact. With tight and engrossing camerawork along with another excellent soundtrack from the underrated Nicholas Britell, the artistry matches the performance. Moonlight is in my opinion the film of the year.
Beautiful cinematography and outstanding acting highlight this crisply directed, highly compelling coming of age drama set on the streets of Miami.
Vou na contramão da crítica, não curti.
nte, Donde la Homofobia es Vigente, y Transmitiendo el Miedo, La Angustia y todo lo que le pase al Espectador.

Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders y Trevante Rhodes hacen una Gran Actuación siendo Chiron, Naomie Harris hace su mejor trabajo Pero quien Roba la Película es Mahershala Ali que a pesar de que solo aparece por poco tiempo, Influye en la Trama, y cada Palabra queda en la Mente del Espectador como el ultimo dialogo ''No. Tú no eres un maricón. Puedes ser gay, eso está bien; pero no debes dejar nunca que alguien te llame maricón

Las Actuaciones, La Fotografía, El Score y la Trama divida en 3 hacen una Gran Película Disfrutable con un Mensaje para esta Época.
Nos habla de la Obviamente Homofobia, Empoderamiento y Autoaceptación, Y hacernos sentir Seguros de quien somos y que somos. y que no debemos dejarnos que nos hagan Bullyng..(Tampoco le rompan una Silla en la Espalda a alguien)

Podría decirse que lo único que no me gusto para nada fue el 3° Arco donde Chiron ya es Adulto, osea el Final daba para mas y siento que decayó mucho...O ya no sabían que hacer.

Moonlight en mi Opinión es Mejor que Manchester By The Sea, Pero no Supera a La La Land y Hagsaw Ridge pero es una de mis Favoritas para los OSCARS y deben darle un vistazo a la Obra, Es por eso que Recibe mi Clasificacion de 4/5
Amazing. Emotional. Incomparable.
One of the best animated pictures of this year, drawing a raw and beautiful struggle anyone can relate to. it's gives hope about the complexity of life.
painful, I'd rather have root canal therapy,than sit through that again.
Barry Jerkins served up the most thickly ironic crying scene since Julianne Moore's breakdown scene in Far From Heaven 14 years ago. It's a sign of greatness, but even though Todd Haynes carried more distance, Jerkins, much like Haynes at that point of time, was too meticulously cerebral that the impression of his manufactured writing does not exactly go away.
A miserable, pointless saga. What a waste of two hours.
Three sketches of a man at different times in his life. By the end of the film the sketches merge into a deep portrait of personal discovery.
Felt like three independent films that were put together.  I didn't really care about Kevin in any way, other than feeling sorry for his awful life.  If the film makers were trying to push the envelope, I don't think they pushed enough.
Oscar prediction: Moonlight is going to upset La La Land for Best Picture. Incredible movie - nominated for Best Original Picture, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Soundtrack. It deserved every one of those nominations.
Dragged out way too much ... boring. Loved the story and the actors, but the lack of conversation on Chiron's part was excruciating.
Seriously, as someone who loves movies and always watch all Oscar's nominees, this is the most boring and worst film that has ever reached this category
Moonlight offre une première moitié de film vraiment intéressante et émotionelle . on arrive malheureusement pas à garder autant le même intérêt dans la seconde moitié
Emotional movie with some great cinematography, Moonlight is successful in telling it's main character's story in 3 parts.
very well done and well acted
Thought this movie was way overrated.  It was painful to sit through, it was so slow and dull.  Im fine with a slow burn sometimes,but this movie just wasn't that good.  The acting was fine but nothing special.  I get why the critics like it because of all the sociopolitical issues.  Black man in the ghetto already struggling, then combine that with being gay, and the uphill battle he faces, but that doesn't automatically make it worthy of high critical praise and being nominated for academy awards.  If you want to go see a good movie about a black man's struggle, go watch Fences.   The acting, story, and everything about it are far superior.
First half was stronger than the second, but this film hit on many important topics. Definitely a top 10 film of 2016 for me.
For those who see the movie without having read the synopsis and have not seen a trailer or any news of the movie, "Moonlight" surprises, as it gives every impression of dealing with a theme and totally surprises, we see gangster, suburbs, drugs, violence, and The theme of the film is sexuality, or rather, the understanding of it. We have a script adapted from a piece, and very well adapted, following a narrative line to which each act of the film represents a stage of the life of our protagonist and all the people around him also grow and all the actors change, with the exception of your mother. We see the story of Chiron, a young man who lives on the margins of society, living a relationship of hatred and love with his chemically dependent mother, where you seek affectionate bonds in another family, living at the mercy of discrimination for your personality and living with Doubts about their sexuality, we see 3 stages of Chiron's life. The film deals with self discovery in a visceral way, it is not cute or romantic, or seeks the discovery of youth through flowers and love, no, it is heavy, violent, shocking, annoying, as I said before, it is a Visceral way of dealing with the topic. The photograph of the film is completely beautiful, with a blue palette, as foci that blur and mix passages, the photography is sometimes almost experimental, and I particularly enjoyed it, the soundtrack of the film is completely perfect, full of instrumental songs that dictate The tone of the movie, he knows to be pop at the right time, and if he uses the music to talk with the narrative of the movie, we also have a great sound mix and a good edition, and the camera strolls behind our characters and likes to film In profile. All performances are spectacular, although it appears only in the first act of the film, Mahershala Ali completely steals the scene, and Naomie Harris, the only one who appears in the three acts of the film, impresses in all three acts, full of improvisations, he is weaselable, amiable , It enters the camera and almost breaks the fourth wall, and the 3 actors who play Chiron play their role perfectly, and it's amazing how the 3 talk in the film, even if very different, the first participation of Barry Jenkins as director Is great, it gives me the feeling that this is the work of your life, even so, let's follow your filmography closely. Finally, "Moonlight" is a good movie, technically very good, sometimes it focuses too much on what it should not and leaves a lot of holes, but this is Barry's choice, although I do not agree I understand, and I really like the movie.
Oscarbait at it's finest. Lets be straight here it unashamedly ticks pretty much every box you need to get nominations. LGBT, check. Racism, check. Substance abuse, check. Prostitution, check. That said it does come together to make a really powerful, moving piece of cinema with Mahershala Ali's performance being of particularly of note.
A fascinating examination of masculinity. The three sections show one boy's journey to 'manhood' and the consequences of toxic masculinity. The film focuses on the good and chances to be better but are realistic about consequences. Heartbreaking and compelling. Mahershala Ali deserves the oscar but I loved Trevante Rhodes as Black, he is one to watch.
Shattering. Beautiful.
The movie has some excellent, emotional performances, However, subtitles would have helped because I had a really hard time understanding many of the conversations.  The film is definitely NOT in the "makes you feel good" category.  However, you have to admire Chiron for surviving and reaching adulthood when you see the environment he grows up in.  I can't imagine how people can cope with the situations depicted in the movie, day after day after day.
Great acting, beautifully filmed and a great direction. Although, the story feels boring and not really enjoyable. Black, gay, bullying victim and drug dealer (am I missing something?), all packed in a character totally absurd, pitiful and miserable. While it is a well done movie, I feel like I've seen all these characteristics before, the film feels like a flooded glass of water, it carries much more things that it can handle.
More impressive and important than the beautiful story that Moonlight wants to tell is the elegant and delicate way that it does that. Full review on filmotrope. com
Straight up art film.  Out of this world acting and directing, beautiful score.  Mind numbingly banal plot.
My God, what a great movie
This is easily the best film of the year. It may even be the best film I've ever seen.
Beautiful. Left my heart aching.
Moonlight is one of those rare movies which portrays the eternal struggles of the human condition, a weighty topic, with such restraints that it leaves a subtle impact on the viewers' minds without resorting to gratuitous drama. The key issues, growing up, struggling with sexual identity and getting isolated, were all graciously depicted in the movie which is so unique due to its theme that transcends beyond the scope of the film while staying away from the usual trope of cliches and stereotypes that often plague movies of this genre. It is genuinely heartbreaking how the system failed Chiron, the protagonist, throughout his three phases of life. He tries hard, time and time again, to confide in people, only to be disappointed by them. But he grows out of it all, older but perhaps not whole, and forgives them. This becomes the redeeming moment of the movie as young Chiron walks into the ocean, under the moonlight.

The acting was just superb and effortless, across the board. I would particularly mention Naomi Harris, Mahershala Ali and of course all three versions of Chiron and Kevin. The direction and the screenplay, both were commendable, resulting in several award nominations and wins. A definitive watch for serious moviegoers.
Beautifully directed, acted, shot, and edited, Moonlight is a must see.
pretty nice story about growing-up. just setting's too heavy due to political concern...
The best film of 2016.
An indie movie with better visual estetics than any studio film and very good music as well.
A well-crafted and well-intentioned look at lives that are rarely captured on film, Moonlight tells the story of a young man dealing with his race, his sexuality, his poverty and his family issues. The film follows him through time, well played by three different actors. This is not going to make my top-10 best of the year list, but that goes to show how good this year was, rather than point out any inadequacies in this riveting drama.
Moonlight uses one man's story to offer a remarkable and brilliantly crafted look at lives too rarely seen in cinema. It may cast a spell on anyone who has known loneliness, exclusion, feelings of inferiority or a desire to be encased in a hard shell to protect a soft interior. Moonlight boasts a true ensemble cast. Three talented actors share the main character's role and the supporting parts are filled by experienced actors and newcomers, all of whom are good fits for their characters. Moonlight is hypnotic not just as a character study, or as a coming-of-age story. It's hypnotic as a performance piece, full of flawless portrayals of a kid figuring out who he is, not just in relation to other people, but in relation to himself. So few unexploitative movies are made about young black men, especially young black gay men, that the overpraise for this frail, sweet, discursive fantasia is understandable - and forgivable. It's a beautiful film around the edges. Although Barry Jenkins' film is indeed about the struggles and difficulties of a person embracing his culturally reviled sexuality, the story is universal in scope and intent. Even when the storytelling falters - several crucial scenes take place in between the various segments, with major events happening off-screen - Jenkins' sharp eye and his film's beautiful cinematography keeps us watching.

VERDICT: "High-Quality Stuff" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)
Definitely overrated and over hyped. Cannot see what the critics saw in this. Yes the subject matter is different to the norm but no reason why this should get such plaudits. By mid-way point and definitely by third act the film was losing my attention. Definitely lack of compelling storyline in traditional sense, more montages of a young man finding his identity.  Boring and overhypped.
Incredible watched it twice now powerful performances throughout!
"my vote for best picture of the year. everything about this film is superb and flawless. an emotional journey into a man's life. the cinematography and score are gentle and moving."
If there is any feeling that director-screenwriter Barry Jenkins captures masterfully -- I'm speaking mostly from an outsider perspective -- it's the feeling of your whole life moving far too quickly to recall anything other than the few moments when it all seemed to slow down. For better or worse. The characters under scrutiny are also a welcome change to the near-homogeneity of most contemporary films, not just with respect to white upper-middle class but also the tough/macho-by-social-law culture of black below-poverty-line class. Moonlight certainly has its important place in today's time. We'll see where Hollywood goes (or Barry Jenkins, for that matter), in ten years' time. As for the story itself, well, it's another coming-of-age, finding-yourself tale. The simple change in who is of focus makes this an especially durable piece of storytelling, not to mention remarkable pacing and structure. "Little" / Chiron / "Black" (the same person played by three different actors, all of whom deserve praise for their breakthrough performances) is soft at the core, and as he ages, we see how his environment forces him to build a cold, rough exterior when all he wants is to feel soft again with someone he loves. I would argue that Moonlight is undeniably beautiful, but then again, see the ~18% gap between critical favourability and audience favourability? The 18% will explain to you how the fact that Chiron is "too much of everything": black, poor, homosexual. And in come the accusations that Jenkins is trying too hard. To which I say, fuck you.
MoonLight was...... well bland. Well of course it's Oscar nominated, because it has minorities and homosexuality and we and when those come in play any movie is automaticly branded as an "audacious masterpiece". But is it really? If you actually take you brain out for walk and judge it as a movie it is glaringly meager. The story altough provocative is nothing new exept the fact that the characters are not white. The character themeselves fake depth by acting as stoic as possible(easiest way to make a character look more compelling than he is). This does not make them anything, but bland. Ok, it does at time gets stoicism right mostly because the actors were good. The story is criminally written. You know like in some books when they infodump and talk about how great and important an event was instead of showing it, because eiter they do not know how to show it or think they are being clever letting you do it for them. Can't they get it finally that there is a difference between not spelling the movie out for the audience and making the audience fill out huge parts of the movie that you were to lazy to do. Almoast all of the main protagonists life changing events happen off screen and we are left to watch the bleak aftermath. It is a very aesthetically pleasing, subtle and often provocative wich I am all for! By all means Moonlight is not a bad movie it's just hellishly overrated, because it has homosexual african americans.
remarkable Movie unlike anything I´ve seen before. Consider it perfect!
With themes and aspects very rarely touched upon in mainstream media, let alone cinema, Moonlight manages to not only give centre stage to much needed voices, it is also a fine piece of work. Layered with texture and depth, the cinematography is rich and vibrant which reels you into the frames. Moreover, the performances are excellent and the triptych framing embodies scenes of some deeply moving interplay.
It's good but not special. Probably the most overrated film of the year.
4.17 --- The harsh reality of this film is that it IS real. A fantastic, compelling story with real characters you can get behind. Moonlight has great acting across the board. Some of the best cinematography and directing in recent years.
Barry Jenkins, screenwriter and director of the adaptation of "Moonlight," is the most recent Hollywood darling after releasing the most authentic film of 2016, portraying a side of black society rarely seen, even when it's in the backdrop of what most would imagine urban black living is like.  The bold and intense movie about a boy split into showing three phases of his life is based on an intriguing story based in Miami over the past 25 or so years.  It isn't, unfortunately, hard to imagine a black youth in Reagan America living in the projects without a father, living only with his crack-addicted mother, that is when she is around, and attempting as best as he can to get through school and life.  What isn't common to see, however, is how said boy befriends the very drug dealer who is supplying his mother's habit and somehow becomes a part-time family with he and his girlfriend.   And it isn't common to see the hard life and confusion within the young boy manifest itself into sexual introspection and the development of a spine to defend himself against bullies eager to mock his preference and social situation.  The path young Chiron travels is one no one would want to follow, but some have to travel anyway. The viewer can't help but be affected by the brutal realism of his situation.  The acting in this movie, specifically by the three actors who portray Chiron through life, can hardly be beat this year, but the movie isn't perfect and, thus, shouldn't win Best Picture, even though Vegas odds have it very close to the movie that should, "La La Land."  The story has its choppy moments and ends rather abruptly, though it comes to resolution.   I can't say where else I would have wanted the story to go and, frankly, it might have been too Hollywood if it did, but the end came suddenly for me and ended with a sweet whimper.  Not to take away its importance in theme, but a perfect film, or Best Picture, it is not.
I truly enjoyed this movie...it was done with care and respect ...the acting was extremely well done!!!
Yes, more of these films please.
Mahershala Ali was great in this! Overall phenomenal movie!
Movie about nothing. Literally, story is lame, boring and not exciting at all.
The power of identity and finding oneself amongst all external factors.
Will never see it again but one of the best movies I have ever seen
'Moonlight' touches on many subjects, most of all identitiy and self-discovery, in an intimate and authentic way that is far from rhetoric. Anchored by outstanding performances from every memeber of the cast, a lovely cinematography and color palette, great camera-work, and a subtle yet effective direction, this is the riveting sophomore effort by Barry Jenkins. The heart- breaking and emotional power of the movie is reinforced by the magnificent soundtrack.
Moonlight compels me to give it 5 stars. Upon finishing the film, I didn't really understand completely what I had just witnessed, it's definitely one of the most provokingly sensitive and probing looks in at an anonymous character's existence and the details that frame his perspective are so distinct and delicate that it's charming throughout. Moonlight is incredibly tragic and a film that feels needed in the LGBT community as well as the general film community. Both independent and inclusive, Moonlight is fascinating, marvellously acted and generously proportioned in both feeling and thought. It's definitely a film that is hard to describe and the brilliant acting capabilities from all three men who play the title character are breathtaking and so so haunting that the film stays with you long after it ends. I can't say if it fully deserved the Best Picture Oscar this year as I haven't seen the other entrants, however it is definitely deserving of any praise that it receives.
to wszystko prawda co mówi?
Great acting and cinematography, but it seems to be missing a plot... 2 hours and it gets nowhere.
with a beautiful artsy terrific movie like this on the slate, that people keep crooning about awards for some glossy hollywood sap musical makes me wanna see laa laa land less and les...
on the positive, this is a terrific film on so many levels theres almost no point in even rattling on about it other than to sing its praises...from the cast to the script to the style to the script to the tone to its camera work
all of it
Light in Moonlight is beautiful, so striking that it seems to tell its own story...which at times was necessary when sound and motion would take a hiatus. This art-house Oscar hopeful had its fair share of dramatic stares, water metaphors, and violin music, but it also told a resonating story about a young man's relationship with himself. The film dealt with his relationship with a local drug dealer, his mother, and other boys, but what was constant was an introspective window at "Little", "Chiron", and "Black" - names that also serve as chapter titles for the film. 

The Take: We're not movie critics, but we might be better. https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/
Beautifully shot and acted. Chiron is a bit underdeveloped as a central character, but that's a minor complaint.
The life of a gay African American dealing with more than just his sexuality is incredibly powerful, moving, deep, and unforgettable experience split into three points in his life.
the thing I loved about this movie how it kept you off balance as well as being very simply told. the actors delivered on this script which is easily one of the year's best!!!
Moonlight is an artistic, amazing story that presents many social issues that are often overlooked. I definitely want to see this again.
Well-written, -acted, -directed, and -scored, this is about as close as you're gonna get to a perfect independent film that is heavily character driven. These performances will stick with you long after you leave the theater. A classic American film.
I LOVED IT!!!! Deserve winning best picture
Powerful film about a young man growing up in today's society, confused and struggling in the world, like a lot of people are. Beautifully shot, with inspiring music, this film although slow, will keep you glued to the screen. Worthy nomination to the Oscar.
Through the soft moonlight, we're offered a glimpse deep into the harsh life of a man.
This is an intimate, mature, coming-of-age drama that features fantastic performances from an all-black cast, and incredible cinematography that truly encapsulates the story this film is trying to tell.
Heartbreaking, touching and moving, my favourite film of 2016
I have seen this movie and I find nothing appreciative. It's just another boring movie. Can someone tell me what's so oh-ha about it!
The lonely and tragi-beautiful world of Little/Chiron/Black, a young black gay man growing up in a depressing Miami suburb is effectively and lyrically evoked not only by the film's exquisite cinematography and the unique, emotional and elegantly melancholic score, but also more importantly by a delicate and wistful script on a subject matter that is rarely explored on screen which allows its audience to piece the story together via a line of dialogue here or a lingering gesture there. All and all, this is a prime example of intelligent film-making by director Barry Jenkins aided by a wonderful and electrifying cast. It isn't perfect, granted. You could say that the depiction of Mahershala Ali's drug dealer is too sympathetic and idealistic but it is also arguable that is because we are seeing it through the innocent and idolizing eyes of Little, the youngest version of Chiron here. The 3 newcomers who play him at different ages may seem a little inexperienced or unsure but their almost awkward stillness feeds into the raw and quiet representation of the character's repressed anger and emotions. And finally, if the film feels a little too neat and tidy, I would argue that this is first and foremost a sensitive portrayal of one man's journey of self-discovery and acceptance of who he really is. And for that, the film ends at exactly the right point, both emotionally and narratively speaking. I am so moved by the powerful yet tender film that on second thought, I think it is damn near perfect.
Brilliant cinematography, loved everything about this film..
Was very good, but sometimes the movie slowed down too much.  Good story to tell; gave insight of one person and how his surroundings effect the way he lived his life
Lejos de la artificiosidad y el academicismo de obras como "La Chica Danesa" o "The Imitation Game", así como del cansino drama social de nulo interés artístico, "Moonlight" supone un auténtico acercamiento a la figura de su protagonista, al que retrata con una sensibilidad que pocas veces tenemos ocasión de ver en este tipo de cine oscarizable. 
Si nos ponemos a analizar superficialmente, "Moonlight" no deja de ser una película sobre una persona que, tras muchos palos y esfuerzo, logra aceptarse a sí misma. Lo que la convierte en una obra muy notable es precisamente que no se queda ahí, sino que realiza una verdadera radiografía social, tratando situaciones como el acoso escolar, la pobreza, la drogadicción y, sobre todo, la homosexualidad, sin que podamos percibir (y esto es de agradecer) el mínimo atisbo de fetichización, tocando el tema con gran naturalidad, dentro de la anomalía que supone la homosexualidad en el entorno del protagonista.
Una de las principales críticas que he leído sobre la película es que cae demasiado en los tópicos. Sí, se vale de algunos tópicos para hacer avanzar la trama, pero por otra parte es lógico, puesto que aunque nos empeñemos en lo contrario, los clichés en el cine existen porque, de alguna forma u otra, se aproximan a la realidad. "Moonlight" no es una excepción, y la verdad es que funcionan. La película en ningún momento se siente disparatada o impensable, sino que es absolutamente factible y, de hecho, bastante probable, que la historia que cuenta sea muy similar a la de muchas personas. 
A mí personalmente no me importa lo más mínimo el uso moderado de clichés, pues la película está tan bien narrada y me resulta tan sincera y honesta en lo que quiere transmitir que conecto con ella en todo momento. 
Me parece además un gran acierto el haber estructurado la película en tres grandes partes completamente diferenciadas (lo cual no deja de ser un introducción-nudo-desenlace de manual), pues esto permite un uso mucho más libre de las elipsis, en mi opinión sabiamente utilizadas, obteniendo como resultado una más que correcta narración... aunque, eso sí, con sus pequeños altibajos, especialmente en el tercer y último tercio.
Cabe destacar también una estupenda fotografía, que da lugar a escenas de gran fuerza e impacto visual, incluyendo algunas verdaderamente poéticas.
Poco más que decir, para mí una de las mejores películas de 2016. 
Habrá que seguir de cerca al tal Jenkins...
Barry Jenkins' "Moonlight" is pure cinema and pure humanity. A modern epic most intimate and unforgettable.
Best movie I've seen all year (if not in several years). Truly, a must-see.
Great cinematography, and an amazing performance from Mahershala Ali add to an excellently put together film.
You could call Moonlight a black coming of age movie. You could also call it a gay coming of age movie. Both statements would be true, but they would greatly reduce the substance of Moonlight and underestimate what it has to offer. Moonlight is about as far from an afterschool special as you could get. It is glimpse at a life and a world not often dramatized, or usually not dramatized well, that moves past expected clichés with ease and becomes an affecting work of art. 

Moonlight is a film in three chapters. Each has a different actor portray the main character, Chiron, at different but important times in his life. In the first chapter titled "Little," Chiron is a young boy being chased by bullies calling him "f*ggot." He finds refuge not at home with his mother, but, in an abandoned apartment. It is there he meets Juan, a kind and benevolent man that gives the shy, quiet boy a meal and becomes a mentor and father figure to Chiron. It may seem a paradox that Juan, who is a decent man, is also the neighborhood drug boss and sells drugs to Chiron's mother, but Chiron's world is a confusing world. Juan's time with Chiron is brief but greatly affecting and memorable. So, is Mahershala Ali's performance, for which he has received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting actor. 

The other two chapters, "Chiron" and "Black" show us Chiron's teenage and adult life. Big chunks of time during which major events occur in his life are skipped between chapters. Other movies would have focused on these skipped moments but director Barry Jenkins prefers to suggest rather than show. It's the right choice for this film. Chiron is a withdrawn, quiet person and his story is one of slow, quiet realization. 

I've read at least one review that has used the phrase "cinematic poetry" to describe Moonlight. I wouldn't use that exact phrase, though there is something poetic about the title of play Moonlight is based on, "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue." The cinematography by James Laxton and the score by Nicholas Britell, orchestral and haunting, are a perfect moody match and both have received Oscar nominations. Moonlight is certainly an art film, but it is gentle, unpretentious, and dreamlike experience.
Tender, emotional, raw and gripping from start to finish.
Nice One But Not The Best One......
7.6/10, my review: http://wp.me/p1eXom-2PA
A moving tale of a black gay boy growing up in a world were vulnerability is punished. A story which celebrates love and masculinity with as much beauty as it's musical scores... Barry Jenkins writes and directes this uplifting tale which, if it wins the best film at the Oscars, is surely not gonna be a surprise.
A strong storyline with clear message which is engaging throughout. The camera work and use of sound was fascinating. The first 2 acts were great but for me the third act lacked impact.
Essentially we follow Chiron, a black kid growing up in Miami through three chapters - childhood, as a teenager and as an adult, intertwined with his childhood friend Kevin. Throughout his mother is played by Naomie Harris. In the first chapter "Little" (a delightful performance by Alex Hibbert) is picked upon as he is small and shy, he is taken tenderly under the fatherly wing of local crack dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), who co-incidentally supplies his mother with her drugs. In the second chapter Chiron is at high school, where the bullying continues. He is drawn back to his childhood friend Kevin (who now calls him "Black" and they have their first sexual encounter - however school play ground posturing leads to them both being drawn into an ugly fight. In the last chapter, we have moved to Atlanta "Black", has undergone an improbable transformation into thick muscle-set hunk (Trevante Rhodes), who now deals crack himself - with many echoes of his childhood father figure/mentor, just with bigger bling. After not seeing each other for many years, Kevin calls Chiron and they meet as adults and reconcile. Acting is superb throughout, with themes explored in a personal, rather than in your face way. Mood and tone are set perfectly with an excellent soundtrack, alongside some very strong visual segments.
El storyline no es nada que no se haya visto antes, nada inovativo o nuevo, pero en estas épocas no es cuestion de surgir con algo nuevo, sino de agarrar un tema conocido y hacerlo tuyo.

Los escenarios peculiares, la increíble fotografia y trabajo de cámara y las impecables actuaciones son algunas de las cosas que hacen esta pelicula única.

La trama te atrapa y no te suelta hasta el último fotograma. Te cautiva y te hace sentir todo.
una historia tremenda, bellamente narrada e impecablemente actuada, hace de esta una de las mejores peliculas del año
don't believe the hype  good but not that good
An extremely sensitive film, sensitive feelings not as a topic
Intimate film of racism and homophobia that executes well, but nothing to rave about.
This movie is a gem. It's story is so lovingly brought forth, in the most delicate way I felt like holding my breath so as not to break the spell of the movie. The cast is spectacular from start to finish and Trevante Rhodes is absolutely spellbinding in the final act. His performance is a primer on restraint in acting. The story brought me to my knees and I will cherish it for years to come.
Moonlight is quite a good, but honestly a bit overrated film. It features excellent performances from Naomi Harris and Andre Holland, it is very well edited and directed, the script is excellent and the third vignette was just fantastic, so tragic and wonderfully conveyed as a whole, but the first two vignettes (especially the first one) felt overly conventional, the drug addicted mother part was never utilized properly and was rushed and the entire structure of the film was typical to me. The film is clever and sometimes with just a couple of lines it perfectly explained everything we need to know about its characters, but sometimes because of its structure, it skipped too many things and definitely felt underutilized.
I was so looking forward to seeing this, having heard glowing reviews and seeing 98% on here.  I could tell it was a wonderful story, the music was beautiful, the direction excellent, some wonderful facial expressions but ... I could not relax into the delight of the film because I was constantly straining my mind to understand the accents.  Also, there was some mumbling.  So whilst I'm sure this is a groundbreaking and otherwise magnificent film, subtiltes were required and I didn't have them.  Somewhat disappointing.
This is one of those movies that truly understand how to make great character development story. The main story of the movie is decent,but the performances by the actors, the story of the protaganist, the editing, the directing, are overall great. It's a solid movie with great script, amazing directing and editing, and a beautiful and talented cast members. It's a smart film.
Well crafted film that drowned in it's own cliche characters and less than effective story.
Painfully beautiful and real. Should be the front runner for the Oscar this year.
Moonlight excels at delivering a character study on this one human's life and his journey in three parts, his childhood, his teenager stage and his adulthood. We see his life unfold in trying to find himself in a world where he struggles to fit in. Moonlight does everything right in giving us a powerful story of the inability to transcend human existence just because they are unaccepted. The film express this one character in a way that's gut wrenching and super dark. With excellent directing, a perfect score, and surprising acting performances throughout, Moonlight makes you feel connected, and it makes you understand what it means to be human, and the adversities we face that mold our way to destruction.
Now I'm not even excited about the Oscars
So beautiful. Wonderfully acted and directed. A triumph.
Everything about Moonlight is perfection. It definitely deserves Best Picture this year at the Oscars in my book.
MOONLIGHT (2016) Calificación: 6.8/10
One of the best drama movies. Beautiful, natural, and very humanist.
Well shot, but overrated. I don't mind a human story but nothing barely happens here.
After all the rave reviews I was very disappointed in this movie.  It provides the same old tired plot that has been used over and over again.  A poor black child, a single parent, drug infested inner city and he is a homosexual.  This is a very emotional and sad situation, but there really was nothing new.  The story line was very predictable except for some of the strange elements.  I deadly drug dealer with a heart of gold.  The character change from a teenager to a young man was totally unbelievable.  He went from a skinny tall teenager to a short muscular young man.  There is no way you can accept a total physical body change from lifting weights and working out as the movie implies.   Finally I saw one critic who said he finally finds happiness in the end.  Yes, he has a one night stand with his gay lover???   Now what, no skills, no education, no future opportunities and he is left to a life of crime modeled after his former drug dealing tutor.  Disappointed ai saw it and would not recommend it to anyone.
I can't find a word to describe the beauty of this story. It was so sentimental, heartbreaking, yet it still stuck in my head, evoked my deepest emotions, for a very long time.
This film is so over rated it's annoying it's just a okay film not all that good kind of boring at times well acted though
No where near the movie it thinks it is. Unbelievable characters, like a drug dealer who is caring enough to mentor a young boy, but not caring enough to stop selling drugs to children who lives it destroys. 

Acting, other than the ridiculously competent drug dealer, Mahershala Ali,  and the brilliant Naomie Harris is average at best. The story  is contrived in many places, and the central gay relationship is utterly unconvincing. Two clearly straight actors playing gay just isn't believable.

Why this little movie has hoodwinked so many people is beyond me, though the ending is sweet.

Very average at best, I mean that's being generous.
A beautiful movie - I loved how repressed the characters were. It made the script so realistic - the actors and the emotions were so held back for the whole movie until the finale. 

The two main characters only ever revealed anything about themselves when they talked, and this movie actually doesn't have that much talking - their scenes are the most poignant because it feels like they learn the most about each other at the same time the audience is learning, so we're all learning together about what it is and what it feels like to be them. 

So many moments made me cry, this was a beautiful movie.
ok gay film black version, so what?!
Well made - but was rather like watching a home movie shot at my secondary school (albeit with pimper cars). For those of slightly less violent educational background, it might be an eye-opener.
This film leaves you with mixed feelings.  It was absorbing and frustrating.  The three phases were intriguing. 

I got annoyed because I really couldn't hear all the dialogue.  Subtitling would have helped with the black American patois.  Really worth seeing.
?????, ????? ??????! ?????, ??????? ?? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????, ????? ?????? ????.
Den var bare trist. Og musikken var bare rotete.
For all its interesting camera work and often neat direction Moonlight is incredibly dull, made even duller by a leaden script. The actors do their best to bring some sort of credibility to the procedures and to a large extent succeed as the bitter minutes crawl by endlessly. From one dreary age, to another dreary age to a 'Broke Back Mountain' denoument. Has gay ever been so dull?
Capturing life on the grain of emotions. How is a life turnout happening? How things pulls you into being formed by its surroundings. The complexed layers of love, hate, self, fear and feelings are all set out to picture here, and surely we feel them too.
Come on.  Seriously?
Once again, for my lovely peeps who want to know my humbly arrogant opinion, and my very messy thoughts of nonsense.
--Who do we grow up to become?
The people who we admire or those who we despise?
Life is full of surprises, hiding in every corner, sneaking up on us, might not be as glorious as we like, but the details are always unexpected. Even for the little people, in fact especially for the little people. The one old lady passing by you on the street; the one man staring at traffic light sitting in the car next to you. who are they, what's their story? They might have the most touching life story you would ever have known, but that's the beauty of it, you'll never know.
When we dig into our souls, under the mask, what's the true face of that tinder heart. What do you really care about?
Some times we get influenced by the people or things around us which we don't realize.
Look back at the past years of our lives. I can't speak for anyone else; but for me, the moments I try to make memorable are often not the days I remember the most, in fact its quite the opposite, its that average day, that non remarkable second.
I still remember sitting in the cornfield watching sun setting into the gap of some houses when I was 7. I remember feeling the breeze touching my face on that strangely warm afternoon 6 years ago in Seattle. I remember the way a guy looked at me for a millisecond that one cold night a month ago.
The most beautiful moments in life are the one you can't quite describe, how you felt the way you felt is entirely based on who you are, and who you have been. Those are the moments that shape us into who we are, yet those are the ones that we can't pass on. I guess that's what make us most unique as individuals.
Although, under the same moonlight, aren't we all "Blue"?
--The film
As you can probably tell, what I talk about often have very little to do with the film which I was suppose to comment on. Usually just some random thoughts I had.
There's a lot to talk about the story, but let's not. The film did a good job telling us that story so I'll leave that to you.
The director/writer beautifully described just those little details that make a day memorable. Which brought the film closer to its audiences. Although I believe the writing on transitions could've been much better. The details were so focused and well polished that middle parts almost got laid out flat, or even just cheesy. 
Overall I believe it is a film worth watching. Soundtrack is also very calming. 
Its not the best movie I've seen recently, there are a lot of things that could've been better, although my judging standard on films is unreasonably high, so don't trust me on that.
But hey, who's got the time to read a long post filled with nonsense like this all the way through?
So good night??
The elements in Moonlight, race, drugs, violence, homophobia, poverty are ones that most gay men are familiar with, as are people of color. Having been through some of these circumstances myself, I can tell you that much of the movie rings true. The drugs, the poverty, the homophobia, the violence are all things I've lived myself, and this movie doesn't sugarcoat them, nor does it condemn them. They just ARE. 
The only thing I wanted, as a viewer, was more time spent on the end. But it wasn't needed, and would have only been there to satisfy the needs of the more romantic viewers. The three actors that played Chiron through the three stages of his life were all very good. They got enough of his quiet manner, his hesitancy to speak, into all 3 portrayals that it felt authentic, like I was seeing the same boy/teen/man throughout. I recommend this movie if you like gritty dramas with some heart.
Boys In The Hood meets Brokeback Mountain!
Moonlight presents three vignettes of a young black man struggling with his sexuality in a poor neighborhood in the Deep South. Each snapshot takes place in a different period in this guy's life and he's portrayed by a different actor in each instance. Writer/director Barry Jenkins handles this film with a skill and delicacy that splits the difference between the roving cinematography of Akira Kurosawa and the unorthodox emotive arrangements of David Lynch. The result is a moving and immaculately-designed character drama that takes full advantage of compelling performances from Naomie Harris, Mahershala Ali, Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders, and the rest of the superb cast.
It's a beautiful movie, both visually and in terms of its storytelling.  The drama is understated yet intimate, and it will leave you feeling a full range of emotions.

Grade: A
An important, and beautiful story, with fantastic acting and script make Moonlight one of the best and memorable movies of 2016, even despite its slight predictability.
I loved this special movie. One of the few I want to see more than once.
Groundbreaking perfection!
A gripping tale about sensitive subjects that is a welcome addition to cinema. 

The tender, heartbreaking story of a young man's struggle to find himself, told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love, while grappling with his own sexuality.

I knew relatively nothing about this film going into it. I knew nothing about the plot, nothing about the subject, and saw no trailers. In all honesty, that lack of knowledge had my interest at a low. However, upon viewing this film, I instantly found out why it was nominated for multiple awards.

The story of this film is amazing. It's a gripping tale with three phases, one phase for each major portion of this boy's life. Each period shows the hardships he experiences as he grows up and takes us along that journey with him. The emotional and physical stress he experiences are so draining that you see just how it affects him as he grows older. The story is very unique in the sense that not many films out there showcase this subject as their main plot, but this film paid major respects to a subject of this level.

The acting was flat out amazing. Each actor, starting with the kid all the way to the adult, were all fantastic. I felt like I was watching the same exact boy grow up with the same personality. It felt like one character and one man, which shows just how well they kept the continuity between actors. They were all amazing in their own way and they each brought something unique to the table. They did a fantastic job of bringing out the story and its message.

The cinematography wasn't my absolute favorite, but I still appreciate it and I recognize what they were going for. I personally didn't think it was perfect, however, it was still above average. The shots overall looked good and the way the film was edited was solid. There were many cases where there were nice, smooth one-takes, and other instances where the camera movement brought out the intensity of the scene.

In the end, "Moonlight" also would've made my top 10 list of the year had I seen it prior. It's an amazing film with a fantastic story that I think many people should watch.
Gave this film 2 out of 5 stars based on the nothingness the movie is. I mean there is moments in the movie where you go "wow thats sad" but all this was was a day in the life of a gay black kid turning into a man.. there really is no point to it. 
There is nothing captivating about the movie , the acting is fine, filming is ok but in the end it all amounts to nothing. This media push to rate these movies that mean nothing in the high 80's is absurd, not sure I will ever ever watch this movie ever again. glad i did not see this in theatres and struggled to even finish it.

In the end you are not missing much by never watching it.
Great actors, powerful yet sad story.
A quiet, intimate film with a universally strong cast. However, the near-constant extreme close-ups and shaky camerawork were not to my taste and I felt the ending was abrupt.
I give this movie one star not because the acting was bad but because the movie was too intense, uncomfortable and in the end pointless. The actors performed marvelously, the issue is the filmography and the director's lack of story depth. Not surprised the Hollywood sycophant critics loved it.
You will watch it. You will love it. You will watch it again. Then you will listen to the soundtrack. You will find yourself not wanting to let it go. It's a unique experience.
If you enjoy a good slice-of-life human drama, then I will say right from the outset you need to see Moonlight. It is broken up into 3 stages in a young man's life, as he struggles to connect with people and to discover his own identity. This is a very quiet film, largely because Chiron isn't a big talker. He's introverted, timid, and beaten down by life. The cast is amazing in every stage of the movie, and they change out almost all the actors every time the film transitions to the next time period. It's a heart-wrenching tale, one that many people will connect with because the themes are universal. So many of us have experienced being the outsider, and wondering what you are supposed to be. I can't complain about much with Moonlight because the film was well-shot, well-acted, and well-written. Honestly, the only thing I can say is that it's not the kind of film that I get super excited about watching. I was invested in it, and I think it is a solid story. However, it's the kind of heavy drama that I'm not drawn to, and the pacing is slow which doesn't suit me all that well. I will watch it again sometime, because I can't stop thinking about it, and I bet with a rewatch I will rate it even higher.
The best film I've seen in a long time. Incredible cast, cleverly shot with such a delicate treatment of what is a very real and sometimes shocking story. See it.
A very thought provoking film.  Well written and acted.

Lots of uncomfortable silences throughout the film that force your mind into thinking for yourself.
Moonlight is my favourite 2016 film of all time  
I miss the film that I so Loved this Film Ever!
Wonderfully told tale of a gay man living in a hyper masculine culture. Superb acting, great cinematography, and great sound design. Easily one of the years best films.
For something being universally praised as brilliant, normally one would expect something loud, wild, and provocative.  That's not the case here.  Instead, we're given a character who's sensitive and quiet with a script that's subtle but powerful in its own way.  We get a look at this character during 3 pivotal moments in his life as a boy, teen, and adult.  He has a hard life and is dealing with multiple issues, his own sexuality being just one of them.  The slow-paced movie isn't a crowd pleaser, but I definitely think it deserves its Oscar nomination.
Emotionally effective, but otherwise pretty blah.
"Moonlight" is a coming of age story about a bullied boy with a bad home life and his struggle in coming to terms with who he is and who he wants to be.  This is a quality film but it is difficult to put my finger on what makes it so good.  Every individual aspect of the film is good but the whole seems to be greater than the sum of its parts.  Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris received Oscar nominations in the Supporting categories and, while both play their roles perfectly, their limited ranges of emotional expression prevent them from having that one moment where I know that they deserve to win.  They are the most interesting characters in the film and I really wanted to see more of them but they disappeared way too fast.  The best performance probably comes from the combination of all three actors that play Chiron.  The character is meant to be shy and emotionally detached so we don't get to experience the full extent of their acting chops, but I was amazed by the consistency of mannerisms between the three actors.  It made it believable that we are seeing this one person throughout three phases of life (lots of credit to director Barry Jenkins for this).  So if the acting isn't the standout part of the film, maybe it is the story.  It hits on two hot button issues (race and homosexuality), though I believe that the important theme of the film is about becoming a product of your environment more than either of those issues.  The subject matter was handled tastefully, with the exception of the one scene which would have been uncomfortable regardless of the genders of the characters.  That being said, it could have been much more graphic than it was and I appreciate them sparing these teenage actors from having to go beyond where they did.  If the story isn't what elevates it above all other films, maybe it is the editing and cinematography.  I appreciated the Tarantino approach of dividing the film into three distinctive chapters to show Chiron's progression through life.  Outside of that, the editing wasn't anything too creative and the cinematography didn't wow me.  Even Nicholas Britell's score served its purpose with its ethereal theme at key moments in the film but it wasn't at the level of most Oscar-winning scores.  It is difficult to specify any particular aspect of this film that has earned its critical acclaim, 8 Oscar nominations, and 50/50 shot of winning Best Picture in a showdown against "La La Land."  Instead, the emotional content in "Moonlight" engages us in a way that the rest doesn't matter.
Managing to do what other films have striven to do, Moonlight manages to tell one man's life story while also examining homosexuality and drug use in America. The direction, cinematography, writing, and music all expertly bring this movie to life.
Saw Oscar nominee MOONLIGHT today, an extremely personal story told in 3 stages of a young man's life--a hard life with little love and struggling with his sexuality. It's nice to see a different setting (Florida) and it's often lyrical and dreamlike...but. man, there are lots of slow loving shots of men washing up and such. The acting is very good. Strong film that will play better for some viewers than others.
Engaging linear drama with no distractions. 
Its 4.5, by the way. Somehow facebook doesnt show fractioned rating.
over rated... I should've known something was up when all these highbrow praises started raining. Amateur film making at its worse. it's not revolutionary, there's no twist and there's nothing about this film that's mind blowing. you hipsters stop with the BS. this is a "Lifetime" movie from a BET angle and nowhere near any film winning caliber.
Moonlight is a fantastic movie.  The performances felt so real and so genuine.  My only flaw is that it does feel a little slow and long but other than that beautifully shot, directed, acted, and written.  Barry Jenkins and crew pulled off a wonderful small little film that is one of the best of the year.
wow... I definitely need to rewatch this ASAP. Its one of the most heartbreaking yet flawlessly beautifully crafted stories I have ever seen in film. The acting by the entire cast yet especially those who play Chiron are just incredible. This or Arrival should win best picture, easily
This small - in a good way - movie gracefully tuns stereotypes on their ear. Superb cast.
This movie has good little boy actor, good teenage boy actor, and good man boy actor. This romantic comedy will have you slapping your knee the whole way through.
Powerful, sensitive and surprising.  Just beautiful!
Story of a child/man growing up in a poor urban neighborhood grappling with his self identity, sexuality and the realities of his present.

This movie is awkward from the beginning with characters sliding in and out of the narrative. However by the end, that becomes part of its charm as it starts to make the viewer feel what the protagonist must be going through.

The normal formulaic rules don't really apply to Moonlight and that is the other part of it's charm. 

This movie won't  be for everyone, but if you've ever felt alone in the world, you should identify with it, regardless of sexual orientation, color or creed.
Not what I expected, nonetheless its great to see these stories put to film. Ones that have not been seen before from these perspectives.
Um filme apenas regular. Uma Ótima performance da atriz Naomie Harris  que concorre ao oscar de atriz coadjuvante, porém não entendi a indicação da academia ao ator Mahershala Ali. Um bom desempenho apenas com poucas aparições para estar concorrendo ao oscar de ator coadjuvante. Na minha humilde opinião o ator Simon Helberg por Florence teve uma atuação fantástica e não foi indicado ao prêmio.
Absolute boring crap, one of the worst movies ever. People who say this film is in any way good are pulling their own puds way too much.
Big idea, poor storytelling. No message.
Here's the rub- Moonlight is beautifully filmed, acted, directed and the narrative split into three acts is both seemless and elegant. I also liked Naomie Harris (in a largely over-looked performance) as the negligent crack- addict mum. The only thing that fell a bit short was Chyrone's teenage homosexual tryst with a school friend. I didn't feel that this brief encounter of lust would have captivated him on a romantic level (especially after the same 'friend' pummels him in the school yard to impress his peers). Is Chyrone suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Is this the only man he's romantically attracted to? Someone who shares a joint and jerks him off, then repeatedly gay bashes him? Oh well, each to his own. Good film anyway. PS: check out the Frank Zappa song 'Bobby Brown Goes Down' if you're into that freaky shit!
A refreshingly cinematic look into some uncharted waters.
Good painfully felt story told in 3 segments about a repressed gay young black kid growing up in a Miami shithole. Certainly not one of the best of the year, but nevertheless, a triumph on a tight budget. The number of Oscars it has been nominated for is absolutely head scratching. It's no classic. The original music score is outstanding and sets the mood for this low budget hit.
An interesting character study that follows one man's life from childhood to adulthood... features good acting and cinematography...While I feel it's been a bit over rated in terms of all the awards attention, the performances are really pretty good.. especially from the kid actors that have not been nominated.
YOU WASTED 110 OF MY LIFE ON THIS TRASH. FUCK THE MAIN CHARACTER HE DON'T BE UP IN THE FIELD WITH THE HAITIANS! LIBERTY CITY DOES NOT ACCEPT OR ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MAN. I HATED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH ITS FUNNY. NO PLOT NO CLIMAX BUT WHEN HE GOT HIS DICK SUCKED AT THE BEACH. TRASH.
This does a great job of studying its subject matter.  I feel certain it is nominated for Best Picture in order to draw attention to it and not a serious candidate to win.   I do think it is better than Manchester by the Sea but the two movies really are very similar.
It was good, watch it if you have a chance but you're not missing anything if you don't
Moonlight is based off the acclaimed play 'In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue'. The play and movie tells the story of Chiron, a young gay black boy living in a hostile area with a drug addicted mother and the way the environment shapes his beliefs and him as a person. Moonlight is a phenomenal film that tells a brilliant and heartbreaking story of nature vs nurture. This is a power house of a movie with so many positives to talk about which is amazing. For one the acting is amazing. Chiron's story is told over threee periods in his life, as a child, as a teenager and as an adult. Therefore three actors have to play Chiron and luckily they are all fantastic. Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes are all fantastic and all bring so much to this character. Chiron is a brilliant character and these three actors are able to add so much both obvious and subtle to this character that makes each version similar yet unique. The film also has some truly exceptional supporting acting. Naomie Harris plays Chiron's mother and she is exceptional. Her character is a lot of the times very easy to hate and also can be quite likeable. Harris gives her best performance ever here as she adds so much to the character and is truly deserving of all recognition she is getting here. Mahershala Ali of Luke Cage and House of Cards fame also stars and he in my opinion gives the best performance of the film. True his character may not be in the film a lot but Ali gives an exceptional turn here as he's both extremely likeable and also immoral and complex which makes his character one of the best of the film. I absolutely loved his final moment as it was so sudden yet so amazing. Janelle Monáe stars as Ali's girlfriend and she is really great and extremely likeable. The three actors who also play Chiron's best friend Kevin are also fantastic. Just like the three who play Chiron, Jayden Piner, Jharrel Jerome and André Holland are all fantastic and add a lot to this character. The acting is fantastic and carries the movie but it would be criminal to not mention the direction. Barry Jenkins does a superb job at directing. This movie is very gritty and depressing but also has a really unique and beautiful dream like feel. Jenkins does a superb job at telling this story and in my opinion this is some of the best directing I've seen in a while. Technically this film is absolutely top notch. The cinematography by James Laxton is amazing! The film looks unbelievably fantastic. You honestly could just pause this film at any moment and just sit there and admire the fantastic colours and angles. The editing by both Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders is brilliant. This movie flows so well and a lot of the cuts are really excellent which is something I can't say for a lot of movies. The film is very well paced and luckily is never boring. The music I also found really fantastic. Nicholas Britell's score is truly excellent and I loved how it gets reused a lot in the film but with variations that appropriately fit with the film. One of the things I was worried about with Moonlight is that because it's broken up into segments there would be a really weak section, however each segment of Chiron's life just builds and builds and it's one of those movies that gets better as it goes along. Moonlight is definitely not a film for all however as there are a lot of scenes that can be quite difficult to watch and at times this movie is a real downer. However I believe everyone should see Moonlight as in my opinion this is an incredibly important film. It tells an important and powerful story and isn't afraid to shy away from anything. It's Moonlight's ending that truly proves how great of a film this is as it's both a happy ending and a soul crushingly depressing one. The whole third act is very complex and powerful just through seeing how the characters have evolved. This movie isn't incredibly rewatchable due to the intense and depressing story telling but it's a film you will not be able to stop thinking about. As for flaws I only have one. At times I unfortunately did find it a bit difficult to hear some of the characters bit even then it's such a minor and infrequent flaw and doesn't really detract from the overall quality. Moonlight is a very adult and mature film about race, prejudice and most importantly love. I absolutely adored Moonlight, it's so powerful and impactful and I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I stopped watching. A truly exceptional film that while not a fun watch is an extremely important one. See this movie now, it's an absolute masterpiece of cinema. A+
I could not connect emotionally with the story; in spite of this, though, I really appreciated the way the script and dialogue were devised. In that way, the viewers are given a great window into how the main character's [Chiron's] life is shaped by each moment. I also liked the pacing and how the story was set up in different sections, done in a similar way to other "coming-of-age" movies (such as 2014's "Boyhood," as others have pointed out) but in a more-incredible fashion. To be honest, each performance from the members of the wonderful cast is so fantastic that I have a hard time singling anyone out (with maybe Trevante Rhodes and Andre Holland as the exceptions); acting nominations for awards consideration are well-deserved all around. In addition, the music accompanying the flick was also touching in its own way, as it haunts the viewer throughout the narrative. This film holds a place as one of my favorite films of the past year, and I am really glad I was able to see it.
A beautifully deep, authentic movie. Gorgeous film, expertly acted. Provoking. Mahershala Ali is a superb actor -- and this is some of his most honest work. Which is saying something.
By far the best movie of 2016
Driven to watch this movie by its powerful trailer, exalting it as 'the reason we go to the movies', i was very intrigued. However, for me the film never delivers on the promise of its first act. I understand that the wider themes that the film is trying to portray but exposition is not always a bad thing when utilized correctly.  The film is intentionally opaque to the point it becomes slow. By the conclusion, the silence of Chiron becomes more frustrating than anything, which is a metaphor for the film as a whole; if you have something to say, say it!
Visually, Moonlight is a masterpiece, and its cast shine as bright, but in terms of storytelling, it is not that compelling.
I thought it was about one thing and it turned out to be about something else unexpected
not my cup of tea.. wasted of money
Hauntingly beautiful and simplistic.  The acting is so stellar and raw that I felt as if I were watching actual people rather than actors. The movie does not try unnecessarily hard to make the audience emotional: the story and acting stands for itself. The soundtrack, on an additional note, was wonderful--it really added to the overall sense of drama and devastation. Really beautiful and thoughtful movie that causes you to think, although for some it may seem "slow" at times, understandably, but I interpret these lulls as the film striving to be more realistic and thoughtful. Loved it!
Reel Dialogue: Moonlight review

Being awards season, this little film has gained world-wide acclaim.

One of the most confronting and brutal films of the year 

http://russellingreveiws.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/moonlight-one-of-most-confronting-and.html
Decent but hard to follow
This was a fantastic, depressing, sad, surreal masterpiece.
A coming of age tale like no other, Moonlight simmers and smoulders and sparks and stubbornly refuses to bend to convention. It's quiet and reflective and deeply, profoundly beautiful. I loved it.
great at times, namely acts 1 and 2. the 3rd act felt pretty disconnected though
Was not impressed, but i understood the message.
Wow. Moonlight is an incredible, intense, moving story with great direction, casting, and acting. I could go on about the little things that made it good, but the material and simplicity of the script were what made it amazing.
I failed to see anything enjoyable about this movie.  It is well crafted, but explores topics that are of little importance to me.
Moonlight is a curious anomaly of a film.  On one hand, it has many of the ingredients that make typical award season material.  Yet, on the other hand (and more definitively) Moonlight has to be one of the more ambitious and bold pictures in recent memory.  It's not everyday that a major independent studio greenlights a three-part drama about an impoverished, African-American man who is implied to be homosexual.  But that's exactly what Moonlight does in addition to being one of the most interesting, if emotionally unfulfilling movies you'll see this year.  We follow our protagonist, Chiron, at three different parts of his life, growing up poor with a crack-addicted mother in Miami.  Along the way he is mentored by a wise and kind drug dealer (masterfully played in a small role by Mahershala Ali), his good-hearted girlfriend (Janelle Monae), and a close friend his age named Kevin.  Moonlight spends its time with themes of loneliness, isolation, fatherhood, finding one's identity, and yes, suppressed sexuality.  Despite its often-dreary environs, the cinematography brings us lavish and beautiful imagery with some allusions to Christianity.  

Bringing this together is a tightly directed package by a relatively new Barry Jenkins, who doesn't linger too much on any one scene without purpose.  It's notable how both Chiron (Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders, Alex Hibbert) and Kevin are played by three different actors representing the different periods in their lives, and how seamless it appeared.  Chiron is lonely, introverted, and reactive.  Kevin is outgoing, charismatic, and intuitive.  One area that mars Moonlight a bit is how relatively short it is.  I feel like an entire 20 minutes is missing, even if that is not actually the case.  But then again if I was left wanting more, then it says positive things about the picture. In a similar manner to Manchester by the Sea, Moonlight attempts unflinching realism and mostly succeeds.  A definite recommendation, with the minor advisory of its heavy subject matter and an unresolved ending.
This is a pretty cool flick. Kind of like three movies in one, in a way. The opening segment was my favorite, as I really liked Mahershala Ali's character.
The first two thirds of this film went as expected other than the majority of the score being classical rather than the anticipated Hip-Hop. However the final third was a major anticlimax. A slow-going film that got slower towards the end but still didn't feel like a drag to watch. 5/10
One of the best films of the year. A painful, humane, and heart-breakingly personal story about forbidden love. Outstanding performances, direction, score, cinematography, drama. I think the most beautiful thing about it was that Jenkins just lets you sit with the characters and be with them, feel what they are feeling. There are no long, forced conversations and gunshots. Instead, there is silence. And that silence is what makes the film truly poignant. And this is what sets it apart from the rest because you find yourself wanting to sit there with them, in silence. You get into this weird relationship with Chiron as he takes you through his life. 
One thing that slightly bothered me in the beginning was that I was very aware of the camera operator, and the fact that I was being "shown" things I was supposed to see. It felt manipulative, and usually directors don't want the audience to be aware of the fact that they are being manipulated. I was very aware of my position on screen as the camera's eye. But, with time, I realized that this voyeuristic feeling was possibly what Jenkins intended all along because it was like I was sitting on the backseat of a car and listening to a friend tell me his story. It brought me closer to him. 
Unfortunately, I watched the censored version and after doing research on what was cut, I realized that those scenes would've added a whole other layer to Chiron's character and I'm sad I saw the version I did. Will probably re-watch an uncut version soon.
I could go on and on and on about the film and how it was almost Lord of the Flies-esque with the use of violence to crush your feelings before they get to you. Sigh. Well, now I know what I'm going to root for in the Oscars.
hhmmm not sure how I feel about the movie. A different story...yet familiar.
A film that wants so much to be artsy and meaningful but comes across as more pretentious and empty, Moonlight boasts a cast on top form, beautiful cinematography and a story which is both nicely told and resonant. When it starts out you figure it's going to be a simple movie about race, but soon begin to realises that it's about something far more personal, far closer to the heart. The first 2 acts are solid, and while it struggles to avoid the odd clichéd character, most of them ring true. Unfortunately, things lag badly in the third act. There's a part where 2 of the characters reunite, and the reunion itself lasts close to half an hour. I got the inescapable feeling that the movie had ran out of ideas and things to say but hadn't yet fulfilled the feature length requirement. It kills the pace and offers an unfortunate anti-climax. On top of that, the camerawork is more gimmicky than clever, the awkward silences go on for far too long, and the pacing is overall too languid to warrant more than a single viewing. I truly admire what the filmmakers were going for, and the message is touching at its best, but it's ironic that this movie is no masterpiece, largely because the director tried desperately to make it one.
Goes down like Baja Blast soaked with vodka and wet emotion. Our species really can't afford to miss a film like this.
This film is a visual film... and by that, I mean, the camera movement, lighting, music, actors' expression are the ones that tell the story. Following the main character in three chapters of his life, we see the journey of Chiron coming to terms with himself and his sexuality.
"At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you"

Backed by Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B, Moonlight done the festival circuit before becoming a darling with the critics. It has since received 8 Oscar nominations and it's probably fair to say that it has become the biggest underdog success story of the year. As impressive as these accolades are, though, there's still an overhanging question... Is it actually any good?

Plot: A triptych story told in defining chapters on the life of a young man named Chiron. From a young boy, (played by Alex R. Hibbert) he questions who he really is before we follow him through high-school (played by Ashton Sanders) and his relationships with his peers and exploration with connections. We then settle on him as an adult (played by Trevante Rhodes) and his coming to terms with his identity.

I have to admit that I really wasn't drawn to Moonlight when I first heard about it. It might have been a film that I would've eventually gave a chance. However, call me a victim of hype if you like, but once the reviews started pouring in and the Oscar nominations were announced, I knew I couldn't drag my heels any longer and had to give it a look sooner than I intended. 

Just so we're clear from offset here; I got the message of Moonlight. I got what it was trying to say. I was even impressed with its artistic approach and it's seamless merging of three narratives. It's a story about connection, sexuality and masculinity. It's a universal tale about self-discovery. I didn't misunderstand it. What I don't understand is the praise that's been lavished upon it. This is, unequivocally, one of the most overrated films in quite some time. 

I'll give director Barry Jenkins his due, his deliberate approach to the material is impressive as it verges on european art-house. Some of his and cinematographer James Laxton's eye for a shot can be striking but, in the end, the film meanders and finds it very difficult to steer clear of contrivance. Frankly, the film takes far too long to say anything. Tedium sets in very quickly and by the time the film reaches its final third, it dawns on you that all you're really getting from this is pretentious twaddle. 

It talks a lot, but (like Chiron himself) says very little. It has been said that "humility is no substitute for a good personality" and this is the case with our lead character. He's very difficult to identify with and any personality he might have must have been kept in his underpants as it certainly wasn't anywhere to be seen onscreen. 

What Ang Lee done for cowboys in 2005's Brokeback Mountain, Barry Jenkins does for drug trapping homies in Moonlight. It sheds its light on the plight of gay men who struggle with their sexuality and identity - especially when living in a masculine environment. It's an important topic which, rightly, deserves more attention but Lee's film was overrated then and Jenkins' film is overrated now. When approaching this particular type of material, I would highly recommend Tom Ford's sublime A Single Man instead; a film that was genuinely artistic and heartfelt, yet was sorely overlooked by far too many. 

8 Oscar nominations? Bitches be trippin'! This is not that kind of caliber and it stinks to me that the academy are trying their best to look politically correct after the lack of black representation in the nominations last year. Giving sympathy votes, however, doesn't right that wrong.

4ipo od mene, nije Boyhood al coeka veseli.
erm,  a film about how life's influences affected a boy in Miami set in 3 chapters.
Ok story. Not best picture worthy.
Tal vez suene contradictorio decir que es una gran pelÃ­cula pero que en lo personal me dejÃ³ con ganas de ver un poco mÃ¡s. Pero esa es su mejor cualidad, es cruda, directa y sincera sobre el tema de la sexualidad y lo negativo que llega a traerle a los que viven situaciones similares a las que vive el protagonista. Gran contendiente al Oscar.
The other day I watched Moonlight and I wanted to take a couple more days to digest it and gather my thoughts on it. Moonlight is a stellar film. It tells the story of a young man who struggles through isolation, race and sexuality through 3 different times of his life. It is very good at having raw emotion from all the characters. Mahershala Ali is well deserving of his supporting actor nomination. For me personally though, I am not sure if I will ever watch Moonlight again. Its one of those films you absolutely have to see but not sure if you'll ever watch it again. It's not my cup of tea but I am still glad I watched it. It was great, but rewatchability is low for me.
Oh what a difference a few weeks make. The movie has pacing and some thematic flaws, but when framed in the perspective of masculinity in general and Black masculinity in particular, the story and characters must be viewed differently. The story isn't about Chiron's love so much as it is his ability to love. It must be understood, however, that the vehicle for this story is chock full of pretentious Oscar-Bait tropes that are designed to get viewers feeling like they're watching something important. But that doesn't change that Moonlight IS an important movie. 

(Original: 1.5) Nothing happened in this movie. Nothing happened at all. We see three chapters in this young man's life, but we don't see him defined. We, as an audience, are automatically expected to care about a character because he's suffered hardship? We've seen these hardships depicted in countless stories before, and we've seen them depicted better with more drama and heart. No one will remember this movie, because I repeat, nothing happened.
Sooooo still wondering why the need for so many Oscar nominations. Storyline is good, albeit weak continuity, up until the final chapter when it all goes downhill.
I'm not black and I'm not gay, but the struggle for identity in your teens is all to familiar to me. As I too was beaten up a lot at school for being to soft and too feminine, the middle part of the movie really got to me. The big difference off course is that being black means the repercussions of fighting back against your oppressors, your upbringing, and your neighborhood is very different from my white, privileged youth. I found Moonlight to be a touching, if slightly distant story with three brilliant actors inhabiting one character in three different times of his life.
Very powerful and intimate look at one man's life in 3 parts. Beautifully crafted and well told.
slick script, excellent cut, touching real story, beauuuuuuuuuuutiful every each frame poster ready cinematography, moving scores, plus from time to time tiny tiny bits of references for film buff to discover, this is a very very well made piece both for commercial emotional intense seeking and art house crowd, watch out Lee Ann cause here comes Barry Jenkins ! have been watching it twice already and 'm going to watch it AGAIN ! ^0^
A rare movie. Dark life story but crafted to a masterpiece. I'm not sure if the Academy is ready for this kind of movie but i think it's time to see real meaningful life stories. I wish this for Best Picture.
Moonlight is such an important film, especially in 2017.  There's no denying that it won't get as much attention as most films, and even most of the other Best Picture nominations, but you'd be hard pressed to find a film more fitting for people to view in this screwed up world we live in.

Directed by Barry Jenkins and starring Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes as Little/Chiron/Black combined, Moonlight tells a story of self-discovery through the eyes of a young boy growing up in a harsh neighborhood where trouble always seems to come his way.  I myself am not black nor am I gay, but Chiron is undeniably easy to connect with in spirit.  Even if the world he lives in is a far cry from how I grew up, there's something to be said for vicariously going through experiences and hardships in a film and growing to understand their vantage point.  I thought in that sense, Jenkins did a wonderful job of establishing a connection between the character and audience.

The cast is notably getting universal praise and it's well-deserved.  Mahershala Ali, in limited screen time, adds so much validity and charisma to Juan.  In fact, when he departs as the film time jumps a near decade, it's missing something without his voice.  Each actor who plays Chiron does a nice job as well, which calls for more credit towards Jenkins way.  Although I knew it was 3 separate actors, the transitions felt seamless to me.  Each actor bringing the same subtleties and soft touches to Chiron's guarded personality.

Much like Boyhood from a few years ago, Moonlight sometimes struggles to create cohesive narrative.  But I guess the goal wasn't necessarily to do that.  It's films like these that need to be told so that people can experience other worlds and lives that they wouldn't otherwise be familiar with.  I can't say I fully understand what it feels like to live with a crackhead mother, daily bullying, and identity crisis, but Moonlight certainly does its best to develop an experience unique for cinemagoers everywhere.

MOONLIGHT-2016(R)-Feb. 3.
By:Clem The Movie Guy.

Each of us struggles in our individual journey growing up, & outside influences; environment, family and circumstances can have a profound effect. Moonlight is the powerful & captivating story of Chiron, a young black man & his journey of self-discovery from young adolescence to adulthood. Broken into three segments, the movie begins with Chiron as a skinny young kid (Alex R. Hibbert) living with his mother (Naomie Harris), a drug addict who prefers getting high to taking care of her son who's dealing with harassment over aspects of his sexuality that he is not even quite aware of yet. Chiron is befriended by the neighborhood drug dealer, Juan (Mahershala Ali) & his girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monáe) who provide a rare support & sanctuary. In segment two,  a teenage Chiron (Ashton Sanders) begins to explore his sexual identity with his one & only friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome, teen verison). Believing that they had something special, Chiron is devastated by betrayal when Kevin is manipulated by school bully Terrel (Patrick Decile) to assault Chiron. In the third segment, Chiron, as an adult, attempts to understand & to recover the connections he has lost. Moonlight is based on the unproduced play "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue" by Tarell Alvin McCraney. Screenwriter Barry Jenkins has directed a marvelous & beautifully haunting story of life, love & self-discovery. The performances from the cast, which features Trevante Rhodes as Adult Chiron, André Holland as Adult Kevin, & Jaden Piner as Child Kevin were all phenomenal & emotional charged. Winner of the Best Picture at the Golden Globes, Moonlight has received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Barry Jenkins for Best Director & Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress (Naomie Harris), & Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali). Moonlight is a MUST-SEE FILM & one that will end on my list of best films of 2016.
It's a toss up with "Manchester by the Sea" as to which movie is the most boring.  Was checking my watch on the timing less than an hour in.  They obviously edited the movie to add scenes with no bearing whatsoever to the plot (making the bed and swimming in the ocean) to get the movie to an acceptable length.  If you have to see this movie, be certain to rent it.  Don't pay full price in a theater.
Excelentes actuaciones.  El guiÃ³n es sobrecogedor!
Simplesmente brilhante
Moonlight is subtle greatness and heartbreaking reality. It is tender, raw, emotional and completely essential. Trust me, this slow burn of a film is a solid and stark reminder of the reason cinema exists. Set in a poor housing estate area of Miami the film is told in three parts as we follow two young men at three stages of their lives. Chiron is picked on by bullies from a young age. His mother is addicted to drugs and he is already questioning his own sexuality. He is befriended by Juan, a drug dealer who tries to give him some direction in life. His best friend Kevin is his true ally. As Chiron and Kevin grow older we follow their struggles and their conflicts. Everything in this film is first rate. Acting is nuanced and heady, music is delicate and effective, cinematography is understated and yet glorious. It deals with finding a place in the world for yourself, overcoming your fears and standing up for yourself. It is incredibly subtle and this only makes the impact even greater. This film is grace and heart personified.
This movie brought a unique sorrow into my mind. The life of this kid is truly inspiring and brought a true inside eye to this kids story. A truly unique and beautiful film Moonlight passed my expectations. Though the films soundtrack did lack and the film felt very long I did enjoy this movie a lot. One of the best movies this year.
A powerful film about self discovery and the harsh upbringing too many youths have to deal with. The acting is cinematically realistic. The cinematography is bold and beautiful. Daring. The music is phenomenal, both the score and source material. The screwed and chopped styled music woven into the story works dramatically as well as cinematically. The score is haunting. It is my opinion that director Barry Jenkins will be added to the growing list of new filmmakers that could be responsible for bringing the lost art of film back to its foundations.
Liberal claptrap not worth the time.  How this won the golden globe is beyond me. Just not a good film.
"Moonlight," an Oscar Best Picture nominee, takes an unconventional approach to telling the story of a young African-American, Chiron, growing up poor and gay in an extremely tough environment in inner-city Miami. Three different actors portray Chiron from about age nine to full adulthood. It reminded me a lot of "Lion," another Best-Picture candidate, because both portray kids forced to almost raise themselves and both movies highlight settings (Miami's Liberty City and Calcutta, India) that are completely alien to me. The acting is great, including Mahershala Ali (as a drug dealer) and Janelle Monae (of "Hidden Figures") as the most positive role models for a kid who is terrorized at school and at home. There's enough visual flair in the story-telling for me to recommend seeing this on a big screen. I really liked it. 8/10.
Some real virtuoso filmmaking on display here. There really isn't a scene here where you don't see someones face and you always feel close to that person. It's different and it's really good. I expected something preachier but what I got was a simple movie tackling some tough themes in the best way possible. Loved it.
Moonlight is a movie directed by Barry Jenkins, and is about a person named Chiron who struggles to realize who he really is, told within 3 chapters of his life starting with him as a young kid, then, to him being a teenager, and then, with him being an adult. I have got to say that this movie was brilliant! Every single part in this film is just perfect! The acting, the writing, the cinematography (which by the way is OUTSTANDING in the film), and the directing by Barry Jenkins is one of a kind. 
The cast in this film was BEYOND brilliant! The score to this film is riveting! I cannot wait to see what Director Berry Jenkins will make next! Afterwards, Moonlight is a masterpiece by Barry Jenkins, and is a great movie with extremely powerful performances.
really real yo lol crazy but so good at the same time
All that to find out he's gay???  C'mon
It is deeply personal and well-acted, although its more affecting moments are in the first two acts, and I feel like it begins to wane and lose direction in the third act. Ali is an obvious standout in his scenes, which are the most powerful of the film, and it unfortunately suffers a bit in comparison when he isn't on screen.
A subtle film where little is said verbally but visually speaks volumes...Not as groundbreaking as many claim, and touch predictable in places but regardless a story worth watching/hearing...
Terrible movie casting humans asnuni-dimentional bloops. Waste of money and time.
It's good for what it is but I'm not its target audience. It's a slow build up of sexual tension with an anti-climax. I one interesting aspect of it is that it takes place over 20 years. The acting is very solid all around. The cinematographer certainly likes to put a telephoto lens on a steady cam, it looks cool but I don't see it serving any narrative purpose. Not a whole lot happens but that is to be expected for a character drama. I can see why people like it but I don't plan on seeing it again
Another excellent film...another nominated for an Oscar...still not sure of my pick
Well acted but too artsy and a little slow for my taste.
Wow! I'll be digesting this film and its many layers/parallels/symbolisms/metaphors/similes for ages.
Beautiful film in every possible way!
Very pretty. Different, a lot going on but at the same time not much at all.
Intense, powerful, SUPERB ACTING! Extraordinary movie!
There must be something wrong with me...not to mention my friend who walked out with me after about 30-40 minutes of watching this movie.  We both tried to give it a chance, but it was becoming pure agony to watch it.   I kept waiting for something to happen and it didn't and couldn't figure out the plot because there wasn't much dialogue.  i wanted to see this film based on the reviews and awards, but was greatly disappointed.
"At one point, you have to decide who you are going to be".
What a waste of time! Characters seem interesting at first, but only the first segment offer any drama at all. The other two offer nothing by ennui. Why do such boring movies always get such high rating from critics? Especially when they are depressing and pointless? Does this describe their own lives?
Fabulous story with tragic intensity and be aware of some shocking sequences. Such a movie as Moonlight doesn't come along often. Truly a remarkable movie: not an easy watch, but a must-see nonetheless.
No doubt a current art house hit & winner of the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Picture but not your typical film.

This film has great themes & performances but it's hard to truly connect with this film & I often found myself disconnected to it.

The story of a young African American boy struggling to find himself & sexuality in Miami. Slow pace doesn't help the film either, may appeal only to Art House Audiences & I don't see it being strong in the mainstream.
An important, entertaining story.  Touching in its simplicity.
Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali are wonderful, Barry Jenkins' direction is excellent, and Tarell Alvin McCraney's story is poignant.
Moonlight is the best film of the year. This is cinematic gold right here. There is nothing wrong with this movie and I am certain that this will go down as being one of the greatest films ever made. First of all, the editing was amazing. That was some of the best editing I've ever seen in my life. Each performance in this movie is absolutely flawless. It is some of the most convincing performances I've had the pleasure of watching. The screenplay was based on the play which was based on the writer and, wow, that is one powerful story. You can truly feel Chiron's struggle about finding who he is deep down and how it is hard for him to accept that. The soundtrack was eerie and disturbing when it had to be and other times it was a little more light-hearted, but for the most part, the music plays along with the tone of the movie which is very depressing. I LOVED Moonlight and I did think it deserved Best Picture. I have no doubt in my mind when I say that Moonlight gets a 10/10.
This film was slow, boring and depressing.  The acting was fairly good, I will give it that.  Hollywood has slipped to a new low.
Overhyped. I read snippets of reviews saying it's 'deceptively simple' or 'quietly affecting' and even comparisons to Brokeback Mountain, and i'm like huh, did I miss something? Pretentious critics work themselves up a bit too much? No tears shed here. While the movie was confidently shot and edited and the acting felt on point, the plot or plot device just didn't produce an engaging story that had any payoff. I was left rather unmoved and blank by the end wondering what was hype all about.
Great performances by the cast. However, the pace was sometimes too slow. A couple of artsy shots with color displays made it a bit weird. The central story was powerful especially in our times. Overall, an enjoyable drama. B-
Moonlight is quite a well made piece of artwork with lots of interesting messages placed throughout it as we see this loner kid grow up and how certain events affect him in a realistic way. Moonlight tells the story of a young black kid who grows up in Miami and tries to live his life, but can't because of the kids who picked on him. He is bullied, his mother is on drugs and there are so many problems going on in this kids life.

But what makes life truly hard for him is the fact that the young boy being portrayed here is also gay. This is something that plays out in a very interesting way. It doesn't stereotype this kid for being gay. Even though there are many signs throughout the film it doesn't highlight them and instead highlights the child's life as a struggling youth with his homosexuality simply being a add on to a already bad situation.

The film is brutal and tackles really powerful topics, and is probably one of the strongest and most emotionally driven films I have ever seen.

Mahershala Ali should undoubtedly get a best supporting actor win out of this, and this film also deserves to win a best screenplay because the dialogue in this film is amazing and captures you when you watch. Maybe not at the level of Birdman or Spotlight, but it gets really close. This is a very well told film and deserves a lot of the love the Award season is giving it.
Here are my thoughts on the movie, I finally got a chance to check it out cause everyone was buzzing about this movie and it's being nominated for best picture at the Oscars this year. I went in with an open mind and I thought it was good. I thought the acting, the writing, the cinematography the character development and the score was great. The first two acts of the movie was really good it was building to something and the third act of the film for me was underwhelming it didn't really went anywhere after that. Overall, I thought it was a well made film the first two acts of the movie was good but the ending fell apart for me.
Truth. Truth. Truth. Real story. Came out crying and understanding a whole lot more than I did when I went in. Thank you for this brilliant film!
Ok, the movie is OK, but i don't understand why the director gave us that ending?, i don't get it, what is the purpose? great acting job but by the end of the movie (When Chiron is an adult) I feel the movie decays at the end from a great storytelling
boring.. I do not like the mix of the themes between the current drama of city streets and a boy with personal sex problems
Brilliant acting and directing. A slow burn that's worth the wait.
So well done, i don't even have the words...
very moving story, director and actors ALL killed it. I will be rooting for them at Oscar time. Recommend!
A gripping portrait of real life. Great acting all around.
Very powerful and unnerving
4/5. Moonlight is not another hard and violent, dramatic low-life film. Moonlight is as tender as the lines grandma said to Juan, with excellent direction and performances from the cast in its entirety (and with the plot-twist of the year).
Brilliantly directed and superbly acted, Moonlight is a film of themes and messages more than anything else.
Deeply personal, beautifully told, and meticulously crafted, Moonlight stands among 2016's most impressive and vital films
Moonlight is unique for not lecturing the audience of American civic education, but telling an earnest coming-of-age story of a boy. It's good but not great and I bet it won't receive so many acclaims if the story centres a white boy.
***1/2 - A significant story given that we don't see many movies made about gay black men. Comes across as very authentic. Superbly acted by all four actors who play Chiron and the direction is approached with sensitivity. Also great that, for once, it does not exploit black people or gay people or stereotype them. Well done.
i wanted to like this but ending was so lacking
The worst movie I've ever seen! what the hell was this ? and I don't know what the critics saw in this this...  stupid movie!
A close up camera on 3 stages of a mans growing up hits hard. Poignant sensitive performances throughout make you believe in the tragedy and tenderness. The action is mostly quiet and the tension and sexual repression of the protagonist though understated are all too real. There's just one leap of faith in the transformation from pt 2 to 3 but I forgive this great film for that.
3.5 Es un gran mérito que una película con este tema llegue a donde ha llegado, pero aún así la siento un poco de Hallmark. Hay mejores películas del tema. Quizás por la conjunción de temática+guetto+negro+bullying le da más importancia.
Wow, can't believe the hype about this movie. Beat out Manchester by the Sea as my least favorite movie of all time.

Go see Lion or Hidden Figures if you want to feel entertained when you leave the theater.

Two hours I will never get back, yuck!
Very thought provoking
Absolutely stunning performance, cinematography, beautiful style, deep, thought provoking. This movie will not only latch onto you but it won't let go.
You'll be stuck thinking about it days after.
Painfully slow. We get it, the kid is in a shit situation. Can he do something about it now? Everything else is great but the pacing is so meandering that nothing actually happens or gets resolved. We see three chapters of this
person's life, but he is literally the same character in every chapter. There is no evolution to his character. Even when he becomes 50 cent outta nowhere he is still the same sad dude inside.
This movie was one of the best versions of an archetype that is starting to get overdone.  That being said, there are some truly excellent scenes in this movie, a lot of good scenes, and a few that are weird/cheesy that kind of pulled me in and out.  It is a touch better than an average movie and there's no way you could give it a bad review, if nothing else than for the acting alone.
Moonlight is wonderschoon gefilmd en verteld het juiste verhaal over hoe een gesloten homoseksueel op probeert te groepen in een zwarte gemeenschap. Al de cast speelt de juiste toon, al is het minimale dialoog toch iets dat ik liever wat uitgebreider had willen zien.
I don't understand why anyone would like this movie. It was super slow and boring. The acting was good. The camera work was weird with some super excessive camera spinning. I think the only reason it was nominated is because of the subject (black gay inner city guy). I don't want to ever see it again and I don't recommend it.
Moonlight tells a new and fresh story that is told extremely well and with care.
Good story. Too slow!!
how can you say bad things about a movie like this? [100% all] beautiful black poor people surrounded by the atrocities of the drug dealing world that still can find some (gay) love, caring, forgiving, understanding and reasons to smile? well, that you have it, the first-of-its-kind movie about back poor gay love in a Trump of Hate era! This is definitely a masterpiece.
Just plain boring. Get what's it's going for, just not interesting at all.
Quizá la propuesta visual más poderosa del año, además de contar con un guión de suma inteligencia "Moonlight" se levanta como una de las mejores propuestas del año. La historia de este personaje es un viaje que interioriza, con la única finalidad de encontrar el momento justo para brotar de esa cueva humana que algunos crean alrededor de sí mismos. Un viaje sin regreso a lo profundo del mar, a ese abismo creado por el ser humano para perecer en él. Una obra maestra, sin duda.
needed the old super gay grandpa chiron
Had high hopes for this movie based on good reviews and golden globe win.  I knew it was bad in the first 30 minutes, almost walked out, but I felt obligated to give it a chance.  Without a doubt the most overrated movie of 2016.    Absolute garbage.   Should have left for my money back.  (And I watched 42 movies in the theatre in 2016 and never asked for a refund).  Still upset this movie was picked over Manchester by the sea and hacksaw ridge by the Hollywood foreign press.
Very well done movie!
A great coming of age film with stunning cinematography and a story that avoids clichés from its setting.
Well acted,  unrelatable story, artistic direction,  decent dramatic moments,  little rewatchability. 
3 out of 5 stars
Captivating and honest, in a 'Squid and the Whale' kind of way. Moonlight captures the lives of Chiron, and all of the various people in his life, incredibly believably. The performances were all great, especially (and surprisingly) the kids and teenagers. And there was just something about Chiron's silence in the first two acts that gave the film a unique kind of power. It was two hours long, and I felt like I could keep watching for however many more Barry Jenkins could push out. My main issue with the film is with the third act, in that I felt like the two actors primarily featured could've used one more take on each scene, just to absolutely nail it. Also, could've used more Mahershala Ali, he was fantastic.
Apparently the year when I can't buy into the movies everyone loves
Dear directors, want to make a perfect film? Make Moonlight.
complex movie,but relative
An amazing film like nothing I've ever seen.
It's wonderful that this movie exists, tragic that so much of it feels to real, and miraculous that it's being so widely seen and lauded. Rhodes and Holland generate twenty times the on screen heat as Ledger and Gyllenhaal did, and Sanders is phenomenal as the lynchpin between past and future. It's an emotional, deeply felt, gingerly observed meditation I still can't believe has seen the light of day. We may live in Trump's America, but we live in this moonlit one too.
I don't know what to say. this is just a powerful movie that deserves to be seen. I can't come up with a single negative thing to say.writng, direction,and acting are all top level. definitely one of if not the best film of the year.
Such delicate subjects, so complex and so real, however, so little discussed. "Moonlight" is a very elaborated introspection of the human mind, in this case we're talking about the mind of a boy named Chiron, who lives with his mother in a neighborhood mostly of African-American population in the city of Miami, Florida. The film is carefully divided into three episodes: the first one shows the little Chiron, who constantly suffers from school harassment by his classmates, and is picked up by Juan (Mahershala Ali) who receives him from there countless times due to the problems the boy has at home with his drug-addicted mother and all the problems at school. The second chapter shows the adolescent Chiron (Ashton Sanders) and the third to the adult, (Trevante Rhodes) who suffers from significant changes in his image and his lifestyle. Every detail of the film was carefully done and completed and Barry Jenkins and guarantees that although he uses different actors in each chapter, they retain every characteristic that identifies the central figure of Chiron. The glance that these actors reflect is incredibly similar, being captivating and hopeful, and this film recounts the pilgrimage of Chiron in his search of identity and in the quest to take a place in society.
The face that shows us from the United States, especially from Miami has been little explored, we know that there are very large migrant populations in this city, but filmmakers rarely immerse themselves so thoroughly in this environment. The situations that happen are so real and vivid that we can often wonder if that kind of things can really happen there, and it really is like that. Drugs, homosexuality, identity, masculinity, race, culture and society are themes that explicitly or implicitly are handled in this extraordinary history and Jenkins constitutes a plot that can touch the most sensitive fibers of the audience, showing few dialogues but natural and very intimate actions which make us understand the difficulties that people under tough environments have to deal with. From the beginning, Chiron is shy, unable to make friends, he is black and gay, so the environment in which he grows is very much against him. Jenkins expatiates to be tolerant, understanding and determined, so "Moonlight" is nothing more than a remarkable film that should be seen and enjoyed by anyone in any context, because this it is a movie for everyone. Moonlight inevitably generates a cinematographic work that provides a new experience, as it is neither spectacular nor with great effects, but it is provides a new full perspective. Chiron as a person was efficiently completed, his performance was wonderful, I stated that adult Chiron had many changes but at the end he deeply shows that he is exactly the same on his inside, so we don't have a doubt that the work of Jenkins as a director in this movie was fascinating. It is one of the most entrancing films of 2016 and is positioned very close to perfection, the language of silence that is used here is impeccable and the teachings that are conveyed are unforgettable. I loved the fact that it was not this big tragedy like many movies of similar themes are, because over time things improved here and everything was well-connected so that the main character would settle more in the place that he belonged: to love and to be loved. 94/100
Beautiful film. Don't think I've seen anything like this before. There's a kind of artor maybe, more preciselya kind of experience with art, that exposes you to emotions or realities that you didn't know existed. Perhaps there are other films out there that have previously documented this experience, that of growing up gay and black in the inner city, where being gay is seen as "softness" and softness makes you prey for those who need to show how hard they are. Perhaps this is a story that's been told before and I just haven't come across it. But this story comes with an urgency to be told. It feels like a story that refuses not to be heard any longer. This struggle to exist and be heard is the struggle not just of the story but of the characters themselves. The protagonistwho has a new name in each act and has outgrown it by the end of that actis visibly and painfully unable to be himself or express himself, both in the moment and in life. Likewise, the story is broken into pieces that end abruptly as the character makes a dramatic realization about himself. This leaves us wanting. There is much of this story that goes untold, which is frustrating but necessary. The end seems abrupt when the credits roll, but the more I think back on it, the more that ending seems like the only appropriate ending.
I only had a vague idea of what Moonlight was about, so I might have to watch it again to feel the full impact that others have described.  I will say the performances were exceptional, especially the young and teen version of Chiron.  There are two exceptional scenes that will probably ring the Oscar bell and a twenty minute dance of empathy that ends the film that was very, very powerful.  This is a movie about becoming a man and discovering your own truth, but then its about a dozen other things as well, none of which overwhelm the central story and that's a credit to the director, screenwriter and the actors and all the technicians who made one of the best movies of 2016.
Beautifully done, with a Oscar worthy performance from Naome Harris.
I felt the emotion of every moment. That is the point of movies like this.
Contemporary treatise on identity pulls no punches and is pure poetry.  Let it wash over you.  Masterful.  Pure.  Deeply felt work.
Deserves all the praise.
To me it's a sign of our times that sensitive movies like this score so high. So slightly overrated, but only slightly

Moonlight Review'

To Start this movie is beautiful to look at the Cinematography is stunning where the camera sometimes is just one shot.

This movie is sturctured though 3 Acts of Chiron's life who is played byÂ 
Alex Hibbert as Child Chiron
Ashton Sanders as Teen Chiron
Trevante Rhodes as Adult ChironÂ 
They all do a fantastic job

Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, and Andre Holland all play the 3 lifes of Kevin and they all do a really goodjob

Mahershala Ali as Juan is Fantastic (of course I don't see him winning the Oscar like most award Websites are saying)

Naomie Harrie as Paula (Chiron's Mother) She also did a very goodjob on Hating her cause she was a very bad word that you should never say.

Janelle Monae as Teresa was good

The Script and Direction was fantasticÂ 

Overall: I Loved this movie its a beautiful movie i would say its like Boyhood and Brokeback Mountain (Just without the Cowboy Butt Sex)
This movie deserves to be nominated for Best Picture.

Overall Grade: A+
A very emotional and well acted movie. I watched this after I'd heard so much hype so I went in expecting gold and it fell short of that. This is a 3 act movie and the first two are great but it kind of hits a wall and drags in the third act. Plus the way the Director handled the camera at times bugged me. Very shaky.
I do not understand the praise and nominations that this is getting.  It has no plot or story.  Naomie Harris as the mother is the only nom I felt was deserving.  The other performances were fair to poor.  I think the only reason it's getting the love it is getting is because it (barely) tackles the little talked about issue of being a gay man in a tough black society.
Exceptional. one of the best coming of age stories i can remember. a beautiful story of a young man growing up trying to find his courage and his voice. it was so great to see a movie like this that actually wasnt about race, or homosexuality, or gang violence. It was about a kid with no father figure and messed up mom, who was lanky and awkward and lacked confidence, who was introverted and bullied and beat up, and used by his mom and by his friends. where does he turn? The way the film played with the moments trying to find out what to say. those awkward moments when we are processing and trying to balance all of things were balancing when we need to respond. our vulnerability, our dignity, our manhood, our expectations, our societal pressures. 

I loved watching this movie in miami. it was very nostalgic for me. i could feel the humidity in the sunlight. Seeing the garbage cans, and the houses, the wall on the beach boardwalk, jimmys diner, hanging out on the beach at night, reminded me so much of what its like to grow up and live in miami. the feel was just right.

the defining scene for me: when Little asks Juan what a faggot is and  if hes a drug dealer, and if his mom does drugs. unbelievable. so powerful.
Love movies like this! Bring me more Barry Jinkins!
This is a film rarely seen in the spotlight; an exceptional anti-blockbuster movie. It probably the most important film of the year because it tells the very real, timely story about the Black American living experience with an individual, trying to find himself while growing up in challenging economical and social conditions. The storytelling is terrifically done with pure honesty and not an ounce of cliches or forced melodrama. Marvelous performances all around, the cinematography is disarmingly vibrant and the indie-filmmaking makes for an absorbing and searing experience. I think the enormous hype prevented me from being floored by the actual film, with subject matter not totally appealing to me, as far as entertainment value goes. But that doesnt stop me from appreciating this unique, incredibly bold creation, which will the Academy Awards will applaud wholeheartedly! - 9/10
This year's best two films validate the Golden Globe's format of two "best" categories, and Moonlight, La La Land and Lion are this year's disparate bests. For me the 5-star rating system boils down to how much I am MOVED by a film (after all, isn't that why we go?). Moonlight is not a black film or a gay film or a coming of age film. It's themes are universal and powerful. Another reviewer referred to the style as Malick-esque in that there is strong use of silence over verbosity (it is not as slickly done as Malick but it is not supposed to be), or perhaps his long absence between films. Moonlight is effective in its rawness and grit. The acting here is Oscar worthy although many characters that each share the screen in this 3-act piece (as a young boy, an adolescent, and a young man), which doesn't lend itself well to awards formats. Mahershala Ali is a LOCK for best supporting actor. If less is more, this is a feast! Go in with an open mind and just experience this film rather then try to micro-analyze. Our hearts can fill in the large blanks and come away with the big story. It is unconventional yet powerful. It is an atypical 3-act play that stuck with me long afterwards. It is difficult to watch but we must, and it will haunt you long afterwards. Not the classic Odyssey tale of Lion nor the slick production of La La Land, it stands as one of this year's Big 3 far above the others. 5 stars for emotional impact and artistic expression. Best film of 2016 imo.
Wish I could give us less the black broke back mountain
An interesting little indie that came out of TIFF/Telluride that quickly took the place on the awards circuit rise when Birth of a Nation's chances imploded. Moolight focuses on Chiron going through 3 stages of his life, as an ackward boy who already is hacing his sexuality and sensitvity bullied at school while his mother his dealing with her full blown addiction often leaving him to wander the streets sometimes until Mahershala's character takes him in, then signing in with Kevin in high school when he starts to fight back and express himself as well, having his first sexual experience with Kevin, and then as an adult having settled away in Atlanta but still haunted by his past and returning home to deal with his mother and Kevin as well. Very intimate for sure, and deals with some interesting themes, the primary one obviously being LGBT rights within the African American community since it is still considered to be a taboo, along with the standard ones from bullying, coping with isolation and personal demons. Defintely worth a watch and for some solid performances from Naomie Harris is the strongest performance I have seen from her since her debut in 28 Days Later and Mahersha Ali in a Oscar nominated supporting role who is on one kind of a breakout year between this film and Luke Cage. Great to see him getting some attention. Not sure how many wins it will received but good to see some more diversity on the Oscar radar,
Wow. Intense human emotion.
Moonlight follows the story of Chiron from childhood to adulthood as he tackles the challenges of his life from living with a drug addicted mother (played by Naomi Harris) to bullying, as well as grappling with his own sexuality.

Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with an amazing and understated orchestral score which is an interesting juxtaposition to the harsh surrounding the characters find themselves in.

The film takes places over the course of three periods in Chiron's life and all three actors who play him are excellent as are the supporting cast, including Janelle Monae who recently starred in Hidden Figures, another film I thoroughly enjoyed. 

Writer and director Barry Jenkins has created a beautiful, powerful and important film on a subject rarely seen in cinema.
A very slow movie with a lot of stereotypical characters we have seen in movies about ghettos before.  While the nuance of the main character is interesting I found sitting through this movie was a chore.
Well acted and well lit character study...but also extremely sad and very measured pace...some audiences will love it ...others will be bored...I more appreciated it , rather then enjoyed it but I am likely not the target audience
Well acted and shot, you will either like it or not, but everyone will agree it's original and powerful.
Best film I've seen in 5+ years. Picked up more of its brilliance in second viewing.
There is a profound and important story being told here in a very beautiful way. Spectacularly cinematic, visually pleasing, we see three stages of a man's life and how he copes with his identity through themes of bullying, sexuality and addiction.  This movie is tactile: soft natural movements against the raw reality. While the narrative is slow moving, it's also compelling. The viewer builds a solid relationship with the main character almost immediately.  Some spectacular shots although I think the last section did not live up to the first two.
Great acting, directing and cinematography with editing. Piss poor story telling and overall flat feel of characters and the movie. Dont be swayed to give it 10/10s because of the gay propaganda, be real. It has some amazing aspects but is let down by a boring movie.
Entertaining but I think a bit overrated/overhyped. I think Boyhood, while not as dramatic (because it was *real*) was a better version of this idea. And to say that black lives aren't portrayed (proportionally) on film is just silly (I can think of a dozen 'hood' movies, not to mention the horrendous Tyler Perry ones). Unfortunately it seems there's only one *type* of black life that people are interested in seeing. The story of Barack Obama? Not so much. Not enough crackhead mom and drug dealing father figures with hearts of gold. The Miles Davis film was pretty great though.
Wow. This movie was sort of strange to me. I watched it after watching the Oscars since curiosity had me wanting to view the movie that snagged movie of the year. The acting was average and the plot made its point about a troubled boy being raised by his even more troubled mom and the struggles he faced at home, school and being confused about being gay... That said, I don't see how it took home such a prestigious award but it was something to see, nothing to write home about for sure.
Nicely acted , choppily told, bit depressing.
Truly gorgeous. I'm glad this diverse film wasn't pandering like other films trying to fill the diversity void. It was art. Emotional. It was wonderful.
Once a year we get an arthouse film that critics feel they have to like to save face. This story of three parts skips past major developments to key characters without explanation, and considering the underlyng topic of his sexuality is so imprtnant to the script it is only touched on (there is a pun in there for those who have seen the film) midway through and then right at the end. So many plot threads could have been developed further and one feels like this  could have been better as a two chaptter story with flashbacks to his youth. The ending is flat too

That is not to say the film os not very well acted and in places a difficult and thoought enducing film. Just not sure it is worth all of the praise it is getting.
Anticlimactic at best. What a waste of time. That's two hours of my life I'll never get back.
Too gay! Not what I was hoping for but whatever. Not my kind of movie.
My Grade:  A+ (100%),...The tender, heartbreaking story of a young man's struggle to find himself, told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love, while grappling with his own sexuality.
Remarkable film.............. no more words needed  beautiful
Very slow not my type of film
Effictive film portrait of a young boy struggling to understand his own sexuality and almost never fully accepting his own inner identity.  Well played characters in every role.
...absolutamente humana! tiene unos momentos... muy bien logrados! BRILLANTE!
SERIOUSLY SLOW.  Come on.  Say something and do something.  I'm not looking for a huge amount of action, just some would be good.  Geesh.
Brilliant movie. Great acting. Very moving, touching movie.
Welp, that's a movie.
Saw as part of Screen Unseen - the tone and sense of foreboding at time was really affecting - I wish the developments were a little more joined up and examined. The film succeeds in showing how society can suppress and distort an individual - some we should all be concerned about or can be victims of.
What a brilliant, tragic and fantastic film. A must see
Sencilla, bien hecha, con un casting impresionante, buen tiempo, buena historia, bien contada, buena cosa. Cine del bueno, del que apasiona.
Am I only one person that didn't liked this movie
"This movie also skips over so much. The guy at the beginning dies and you never hear how he dies and it pissed me off. Then the guy gets arrested and you never hear how anything turns out. " ---  After I saw this comment in another review, I realized this was one of the primary reasons why I LIKED THIS MOVIE: I treated me like  grown up.  It did not spoon feed me every detail for detail sake. It allowed me to make my own story about what happened, and the surprising thing was that some of those assumptions were stereotypical and even borderline racist.  I was not expecting that.  But a little self awareness is a good thing, and this film intentionally or unintentionally did that for me.
Good story and well acted.  First and second scene were fantastic, the third scene was good, but a little slow.  Great story line and realistic.
Even though it was written well it still leaves the viewer with alot of unanswered questions and has too many open ended parts.
Didn't really know anything about the movie except for the name and it turned out pretty good!
'Moonlight' to put it simply is this year's 'Boyhood', but where the way it tells this coming of age story is done in a similar fashion, the story is distinctly unique focusing on many different more heartbreaking and emotional themes than Linklater's 2014 masterpiece. Moonlight is a Drama that follows the life of Chiron, a young man who as he moves through adolescence to adulthood experiences pain, heartbreak, love, and all the while is faced with struggles revolving around his troubled family and sexuality. This is a movie that drags you in with emotion, and as it progresses through the various stages of Chiron's life you grow attached to this character who you care about and by the end feel like you fully understand. On top of the heartbreaking story, every scene of this film is expertly crafted by Barry Jenkins through great use of striking filming techniques combined with a score that is sure to stick with you once the film is over. The performances in the film are fantastic across the board, from main roles to the supporting cast everyone here gave it their all and it pays off greatly. 

One of the biggest difficulties a film like this has where you are following a character through multiple stages of their life is making sure it feels like you are watching the same person all the way through. When you have multiple actors stepping in and adopting the role for different ages it can get tricky with whether they don't fit appearance-wise or one actor might depict character traits differently from the last. But with Moonlight one of the most astounding things is that whether you are watching Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, or Trevante Rhodes portray Chiron you fully buy into the fact that this is the same person at every moment. Every character trait and nuance including the way Chiron moves, his facial expressions, how he talks, and how he gestures is so accurate and consistent from actor to actor that you might even buy into the fact that it is one actor from beginning to end. All three actors has such a grip on this character and it really did help to connect all three acts of the story together. 

As for the other supporting roles, Naomi Harris and Janelle Monae, put in very strong performances that add too the story and understanding Chiron's development and upbringing that made him the man he would become. But the one actor who undeniably steals the entire film with extremely minimal screen time is Mahershala Ali who plays Juan in the film. His performance here is truly phenomenal where in a very short amount of time he has some of the most powerful scenes, and some of the most emotional moments in the entire film. You may go into this film thinking of Ali as Remy from 'House of Cards' or Cottonmouth from 'Luke Cake', but within 5 minutes of this film beginning i promise you will forget about all that and only see him as the character he is portraying here. When it comes to Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars this year, there is no doubt in my mind the most deserving will be Ali who managed to steal this entire picture with only 15 minutes of inspiring and powerful acting. 

The way this film is shot creates beauty out of every scene with camera techniques that show off some very striking and confronting visuals and convey the emotion and darker tones with no dialogue necessary. It also includes a score that is so expertly intertwined that you will find it constantly sneaking into scenes and immersing you into what is on screen without you even realising until after it stops. But in terms of negatives although i did love much of the third act of the film for the ways it ties everything up i thought the pacing in this act was a little too slow. I mean, yes the entire film does hold a slow pace but with everything coming to a close i thought it was just meandering through the final act and it came to a very low key but also very satisfying ending emotionally. 

So in the end this is definitely a strong contender for Best Picture and if it does win it would be very well deserved. Personally it wouldn't be my #1 pick for the award but it definitely has a strong chance. The way the story follows Chiron through the key moments of his life is expertly handled and the three performances that go into this character are linked fantastically creating the illusion that you are following a single performance right through. But when discussion of Moonlight comes up in the future it will no doubt be focused around the performance by Mahershala Ali that is as i mentioned; so good that he steals the entire film with only 15 minutes. It is an emotional film and more of an 'Oscar' style film with a great story and amazing characters to drive the story forward, definitely one to check out this awards season. 

8.2/10
Don't try so hard to categorize this one. It's a film about the human condition expressed through black lives. The characters are so universal that age-old stereotypes are subverted and masculinity is show in a different light. Through clever usage of cinematography and jumps in time, the film has a unique atmosphere that doesn't seem contrived or dramatized. It's a film that will make you want to cry.
It wasn't what I had expected. I'm still trying to analyze what I saw. As a kid, I had a lot of trouble speaking up and with expressing myself and my issues but I wasn't as bad as that guy. I kept wanting to just yell out at the screen "speak up motherfucker". Very good movie that highlights many issues that are still very real today in the lower socioeconomic communities.
Slow moving and no great payoff.
brutal honest look at growing up in the hardest way a must see unbelievable acting!
I must say, it's been a long time since a movie has touched me like "Moonlight".  And, really, that's the central focus of the film; who are the people that touch you in life, physically, emotionally, mentally.  The movie is a little slow at times, but never drags.  Outstanding performances from all involved.  This is a movie that needs to be seen if you ever felt lonely...and I think we all have.
Few films have the power of making you see you're watching an all-time classic, and a masterpiece, since the very first minutes and never lets down, till the very much perfect ending. Deserving all praise it is getting and certainly, even more.
One of 2016 best and most emotional and gritty movies. The story is sad to watch and the acting is too notch. It screams oscar.
You lost me with Juan - the drug-dealer with a heart of gold.
Not only is this film a masterpiece in storytelling, acting, directing, etc., it's also so important for modern society that it is not only one of the year's best films, but it's the year's most essential film as well.
A superb coming of age story of the troubled lives of youth in the black community.  This shows how one wrong move can mean the difference between success and failure in all areas of life.
Poetically narrated and stellar ensemble acting, Moonlight isn't an easy watch, but a necessary one that provides moviegoers with a visceral and poignant look into the lives of "others."
Amazingly good film! So raw and poignant. Very emotional.
The most beautifully, devastatingly honest 'black life' movie I've seen in a long time.  Hell, the music alone...
Unclear Story.  Underdeveloped character.
Dull and slow moving.
Slow moving and not intriguing.
At times unbearably beautiful & mournful with the finest performances imaginable. Characters who break your heart, repeatedly, and you want to come back for more, because it tells the truth. A profound & brilliant film.
a black gay man journey throughout life.something that we couldn't see in a movie a few years ago.very raw and realistic,moonlight is a different film that captures something that it could be hard to swallow for some,but it will definitely be praised by others.
Pretty good. Hard to watch gay seens if I'm being honest, like broke back mountain, but still a good movie.
There's a good reason why this movie is "too rarely seen in cinema".  It's terrible, displaying life on the outer edge in it's darkest forms, devoid of all hope and charity. quite unlike real life for most people.  Likely another effort on the part of some fringe group to shove some realism down our throats, the more uncomfortable the better?  Very disappointing.
most overrated movie is '16
Moonlight is sure to strike a chord with anyone who has ever struggled with their identity, or succumbed to peer pressure and backstreet politics.
Charting one man's impenetrable loneliness through childhood, adulthood and in-between, this highly personal film invites us to share central character Chiron's pain and confusion.
Barry Jenkins' tender yet intrusive approach to direction echoes the kind of taut social realism once perfected by the Italians, and the whole thing screams authenticity in terms of tone, character, dialogue and devastation. Graced by immaculate performances and a restrained romance guaranteed to break hearts, Moonlight is living proof that there is beauty to be found in hopelessness - or is there?
OK so I have read some user reviews and then ones who hated it said why in pretty much three different ways in that it was either slow, they had a problem with it being another black struggles movie or they had a problem that the main character was gay. now I'm fine with people's opinions on this being to slow because it does have a slow pace and not everyone can gravitate towards that but when you say it's a "Liberal" movie and you decide to say that it's a terrible movie because it's not a movie that about the way you think it should be based on politics then that's just flat out dumb and when you dislike because it has to do something with the gay community then that's also dumb try to enjoy the movie for the art like how the cinematography is gorgeous or the occasional tracking shot and beautiful acting to where if one of the 3 actors had not done amazing it could have destroyed the movie but every actor was perfectly cast and it's a heartbreaking story where at times it felt I wasn't watching a movie but something true and real right before my very eyes so please everybody give this movie a shot the fact that not a lot of people have not seen it is tragic
Golden acting all around can't make up for Moonlights' formulaic, depressing and overall self-indulgent ploys for attention that's been given to several, better films with the same basic story.
'Moonlight' is the story of Chiron, a small African-American child growing up in the poorer neighbourhoods of Miami. It's told in three 35min blocks - Chiron at ~7 is called 'Little' and played by Hibbert, where he escapes bullying and his mother's drug habit by finding a role model in Juan (Ali). Chiron at ~17 is played by Sanders as he struggles through high school. Chiron at ~27 is called 'Black' and is played by Rhodes after he has moved to Atlanta.  

The film's a little too arty in parts, putting in sweeping/annoying camera angles and movement when not needed, and a bit too much of the over-dramatic score when one of the actors is just starting at the camera. It does seem to take a while for anything to happen, and - even though you feel sorry for him - I never grew to care too much for Chiron, as you never get to really know him.

The character of Kevin (Piner/Jerome/Holland) becomes more interesting each phase, but also seems a bit underdeveloped. There's some nice moments, particularly with Juan and Teresa (Monae) - both underutilized - but it all ends abruptly and you feel like you witnessed Chiron grow up, but not really do anything...
A very good movie, you can feel the pain of the main character. Didn't feel it lived up to the hype though.
One scene made me question whether it was a good or awkward scene but it was very enjoyable
Raw, emotional, quiet and powerful.
Downer version of Boyhood. Seemed very 'made for tv'.
Powerful and affecting.
I, thoroughly, enjoyed the movie... but, I was left wanting more... I feel that the story didn't give me sufficient closure.
i must admit at first i thought it would be violent and had to stop watching, but right after i continued, it got better and surprising and i liked it. I don't like open endings myself but the academy loves french endings so i hope it does well. a good movie.
It's a good movie. You really feel for the main character most of the time. Until modern issues are lazily shoehorned in.
Me decepcionó bastante. No aporta nada nuevo y es bastante aburrida
Ok, this was a GREAT movie. I'd like to start by saying that the acting was phenomenal, with great praise for Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris. This is a movie about a kid, Shiron, who is raised in the suburbs of Miami, and continuously abused and harassed by other kids because he is gay. Because of this, he maintains a low profile and is very shy. He is very strong through  this never-ending ordeal, even with the fact that his mother is a drug addict and abuses him verbally as well, which Naomi Harris does a FANTASTIC job as. So what happens is the kid is "rescued" and "adopted" by Mahershala Ali's character, who helps him understand his sexuality until he dies. What I have a problem with is that Mahershala Ali won an Oscar for this performance. His performance was nothing NEAR Oscar worthy. He was only in a third of the movie, only appearing
Moonlight is a movie with a lot to say, and at times maybe too much about many topics.  Poverty, race, sexual preference, bullying, drugs, parenting and friendship are many of the topics covered in this well made film.  I liked this one, even though the pace of it was a little too deliberate for me.  Don't get me wrong, it is a very good film, but I think it is trying to say too much about too many things at times.  So therefore, there are some items or relationships to me that go unresolved in the film.  However, maybe that is the purpose, and that sometimes in life we don't get to wrap up everything with a nice pretty bow.  What this movie is good at showing are the relationships the main character has throughout his life, and how they shape him both good and bad.  It also shows how many of us tend to live our life trying to be what we think others want us to be or act, and not ourselves.  That is certainly something this film gets right.  There are some excellent performances here, as the little known cast is very good.  The director does an excellent job of telling this story with some really good camera angles and perspective that we just don't see all the time.  This isn't my favorite picture of the year, but I can see why it will be up for Best Picture come Oscar time.
Plays out like a rushed Boyhood. 

It was always going to be tough coming out in the ghetto but even tougher when your mam is a crack head and your the school punchbag.  

Ali is fantastic in his small role and a serious twitch off Monae. 
Decent coming of age drama.
Horrible , I don't get all the hype! La la land should've got the award!
Its an interesting film, a sad film, a film with a lot of heart.  You truly feel what Chiron / Little goes through and its a journey full of heartbreak.  Its a film that should be watched and its nice to see a small indie film do what this film is doing.
Powerful story and powerful performances, especially from Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Trevante Rhodes. There is nothing cheesy or Oscar-bait in this movie. It's authentic and emotional. Hope it will be between Moonlight and Arrival in the Oscar run for Best Motion Picture. 
Great work, Barry Jenkins!
Too good, too real, everything on this film was excellent!
This seems like a cheap knock off of Boyhood.  The characters and actors are all great in this film but the story seems to be a bunch of stereotypes.  In the end the main character was supposed to find himself.  You can be the judge if that is the case.
Very good movie. Great acting and great story. It's a classic love story filled with many cultural situations that occur today. But, the one complaint I have is that it was a bit drawn out for a love story. It could've been shortened by a half hour and still had the same effect. I couldn't really tell what the theme or conflict of the movie was.
The subdued performances cover over a deep emotional core, with excellent performances and a rich lush look. This is film about an America rarely seen but no less vibrant or hypnotic, despite the hard to understand dialogue.
It covers new territory so beautifully <3. Great casting!
Universal truths for some.
This is the best film I have seen since "Birdman", though I suppose "Brand New Testament" would be close behind.  It is as perfect as a movie gets- the cinematography and its moving camera drips with emotion without a word being spoken, the script is as tight as that of the drum taut (hah!) "Whiplash", and the story is something you have never seen before and that few of us ever really think about.  So much emotional realism drips off the screen with such sparse dialogue, that it feels surreal in the very best way to sit through.  Although a film about loneliness and alienation, it is inherently uplifting.  Great performances from both children and men, performances that rely on long, uncomfortable silences and facial expression, very difficult to pull off.  Amazing from first shot to last, and after seeing most of the other Oscar contenders, I have to believe that this is our best picture.  One of the very best in a decade, an absolute home run.
Moonlight is a film which goes a long way both artistically and socially, The contrast between the three chapters really highlights the pain and the struggle and that's exactly what Barry was going for, What sticks out the most is the intense and raw plot which sometimes fell flat due to lack of details but as an overall story it was solid, The best thing that Moonlight has to offer was the acting, Pain is not an easy emotion to showcase but all three actors who played "Chiron" preformed wonderfully, The camera work on the other hand is spectacular and a joy to watch
Not my demographic.  Movie tells story well of young gay boy - and makes people feel for the boy and teenager - but really drags through most of the film.
A modern drama about the acceptance, pain and heartbreak, so nostalgic, but not sensationalist.
Jesus. Just gorgeous.
A film for men about growing up and how masculinity can play a key role in the process. It's pretty tragic and moving. I haven't seen anything quite like it in 2016. It's hauntingly shot (by James Laxton) and scored (by Nicholas Britell). Everything comes together to tell the story of a young boy's journey into manhood. Haunting, hypnotic, complex, intensely intimate. and quite memorable...there is no doubt that Moonlight is one of the best films of 2016. It's one I'm sure I will continue to think and talk about.
Moonlight is an interesting character study that has an undeniably unique sense of style. The film seemed to be overstuffed with cultural woes, which for me made it harder to center around one issue. However, the first sequence of the film was very well done and Mahershala Ali was excellent
A moving and sincere chronicle of this beautiful young man's journey through life brought to fruition and reconciliation in the final trilogy. Fantastic musical score - superb acting.
Outstanding movie. Glad I went to see it.
A masterpiece.  A unique and unexpected story that features characters rarely featured on screen and with such grace.  An examination of hyper masculinity and homophobia both external and internal.  The whole ensemble is incredible.  An absolute must see.
This was a totally boring and disappointing film
Well told story were I laughed and cried.
Good thing I got a screener and didn't pay for a babysitter and movie tickets.  I really hoped I'd love this movie.  What's the hype?  No one likes a black-kid-with-a-crack-addicted-mom movie more than me.  No one. And yet, this just bored me to sleep. Literally.  Took 3 nights to see it and lots of late afternoon coffee to try to stay awake.  I think I get it why it's getting all the great reviews.  I get it.  It's a black movie.  We need them.  The more the merrier.  We also need to address bullying.  Let's make some more bullying movies please.  We also need more gay movies.  Let's please make some gay movies but where the gay men actually seem gay, even if just for 3.  So after having watched "Broke Black Mountain," let me just say that I was utterly disappointed.  No action.  Zero plot.  "Boyhood" had more plot and that didn't have a plot either.  Minimal action. Barely any dialogue (I guess the introverts are in this awards season... i.e., Casey Affleck in "Manchester By the Sea").   Casting was just totally not good (3 actors depicting 3 stages of life didn't even resemble each other).  No really sweet and tender moments.  Plus, these guys are in Miami.  How repressed and closeted can you be in a city where at least 5% of its population falls into the LGBT category? I really wanted to see a kid that struggled in youth grow up to go away to college and get his shit together and get married to a gay man in San Francisco.  There was no character growth for any of the characters. Sorry, this just didn't work for me and based on the description of this movie, this should have been "my" movie this year.  A real snoozer, this movie was. Moving onto the next....
'Moonlight' is an artful and subtle film backed by a powerful screenplay & excellent performances.
A beautiful character study of sexuality and identity.
Moonlight gained such acclaim less for its finesse and more for its willingness to go where so few films go thematically ... The style is familiar, but the level of intimacy is not.
This kind of film does not come around often. It's raw, unfeathered, real and brought to life by some amazing acting. This isn't a crowd pleaser this is a movie about life and how it is for many people and we never really talk about or see on film.  A must see and potential film of the year winner. It's not perfect but man is it eye opening!
Extremely inspirational, Astounding soundtrack, and Incredible performances from Cast & Crew.
What great cinema is all about; allowing the viewer to have a look into a world that is far from their own, with compassion and style.
Needless to say, the acting, cinematography, directing, and even scoring are all exceptional, but what truly stands out in Moonlight is it's ability to portray how a person can change based on the events that transpire in one's life. How certain things can make you curl up into a ball, never to be unraveled again - or as the movie calls it "going hard"- which is precisely what Chiron goes through in the three stages of his life. For that alone, I tip Barry Jenkins my hat, for the masterpiece he has created will touch many souls around the world who have gone through the same transformation.
Definitely one of the Oscar front runners. Was a little slow at times and the ending could have been more seamless. Still one of the best of 2016. The acting was phenomenal.
LGBT eat your heart out!.. A film that rubs your nose into the life of a young homosexual  man. It is a liberal lesson to all and also abit too much for my liking. If you enjoy watching men kissing and homo-erotic beach scenes. This film is right up your alley!
wow!! just wow.....I saw this film yesterday at night and I´ve been thinking about it the whole day, moonlight is a pretty little film, but told in such a big way.
every actor, every scene, every word, is gorgeous.
I have to say I love this kind of movies, movies about one person in a determinate point of their lifes struggling about find themselves, and this one was just awesome, so beautiful to watch and always with that tone, that tone that makes you feel exactly how the main character is feeling, it is simply amazing.
the life of Shiron is tragic, since the movie begins we know his life will be hard, he is a little gay boy in a world of black people in florida in the 90s, he suffers from bullying from the other boys in the neighborhood, his mom is a drug addict who always invite strangers to their house, and Shiron feels completely alone. 
along the 3 stages of the life of Shiron the movie present us, you can feel how much is is struggling to find their way into life, how can a black gay boy survive in a world like that.....just left me speechless
the movie is masterful directed, you note the director presense in every frame.. directing awesome actors, I found the entire cast tremendously perfect, the cinematography is so beautiful too, some of the scenes are shot almost poetically.
I have no words to explain how much I loved this film, must see it, definitely a masterpiece.
such as boyhood did in 2014, this film is not great for telling us an ambitious story, it will be known for all those little beautiful sequences that leave you breathless.
Moonlight is a well-acted indie drama that delves deep into universal issues from an usually neglected perspective - and the result is as beautiful as it s painful.
Very films can capture reality like Moonlight.  It portrays events in a realistic fashion like very few films do. The direction was great, the performances all-around form the best ensemble performance I've seen in years, and the vision of a gay black man in America was done with such honesty. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Calling the plot predictable would be an understatement, but the perspective and in depth look at the subject matter is what makes this film so unique. All three acts are able to deliver groundbreaking insights and force the audience to do nothing besides pay close attention. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, and more importantly it's an experience that sticks with you.
Would have been a 5star except the dialogue was so muffled at times I could have used subtitles.
Incredibly natural performances and a totally believable world made Moonlight one of the better films of 2016. The story is told simply, with the strength of the characters moving this tale of seeking one's identity forward to its conclusion. It moved in directions I did not expect, but that were absolutely true for the characters involved.
Amaizing movie ,the best movie of the Year !!!!  The producer is fantastic .
The last 30 minutes of the movie is drawn out without conclusion.
Fair, not that original however.
wow, I'm speechless. what a great story.
Like a Miami ghetto Brokeback Mountian
UAU... que filme maravilhoso e dolorido. Uma preciosidade imperdível!
Moonlight is a captivatingly, sometimes painfully human movie and a critical character study. It's an unbreakable gaze into hard American truths, beautifully dappled in blues and golds, moods and emotions.
The deepest wounds of youth are the most significant and pronounced of a lifetime; it shapes who you become. This was a bittersweet story told in three chapters; childhood, adolescents and adulthood.
Powerful and emotional journey through the life of Little/Chiron/Black. Wow. Just a beautiful and real film. The performances are all unbelievable, especially Ali & Harris. The direction/writing are brilliant. What a movie.
Bullying, poverty, drug abuse. Moonlight is split into 3 short stories of a boy, teenager and a man as he struggles through each aspect of his life as a gay person in a gangland environment. Very romantic and moving, will be certain to win many awards this season.
Affecting and captivating. It's a good story, but its' not all that bold.
10 out of 10:

Smart premise, great acting, and touching, Moonlight gives us a different look at growing up.
Great work of art!  Absolutely loved the scene in the diner.  The anticipated first eye contact was so beautiful.  Took my breath away.. Great directing in this film.
Good movie. I didn't realize this movie was a LGBT movie until about half way in and I didn't know how I felt about it. But with that said the movie is still good and it shows you the struggles a gay person can go through. I thought everyone did a good job and it captured everything well. 
85/100
A rollercoaster ride of emotions.  Well done and worth the time.
"This above all: to thine own self be true." That pretty much sums up the movie.  I suppose that I'm not as rapturous as most of the critics--nothing so new about all the "In da Hood" stuff. However, I doubt that I will see better acting this year. The adult Chiron/Black had me absolutely transfixed. He and the child were amazing.
Barry Jenkins' second feature is a truly terrific human story of the power of love, the life of Chiron first off showing him as a nine year old elementary school pupil, to freshman year of high school finally a full-grown coping life of what it's like to be black, poor and gay. Based Tarell Alvin McCraney's high school project play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, Moonlight is a beautiful black-cinema masterpiece filled with a lot of tension, brimming with vibrant colour, a lot of love, hate and depression. Filled with phenomenal Oscar-worthy performances. 5/5 truly excellent.
Based on the talk surrounding it, as I walked into MOONLIGHT I was prepared for it to be another BOYHOOD situation, a critical darling hyped up beyond all reason and recognition.  Thankfully, MOONLIGHT is an actual good film with many affecting moments... even as it's also quite flawed structurally.  The movie's strongest element is the acting, which is terrific across the board; Mahershala Ali makes an indelible and authentic impression with relatively little screentime, while the trio tasked with portraying the protagonist - Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes - do some remarkably subtle things which illuminate the different facets of the character they're playing.  The filmmaking from director Barry Jenkins is often strong (he absolutely knows how to put together a compelling scene), and he has a definite voice that can be felt coming through.  On the page, the movie is creative and interesting from a structural standpoint, but this is both a strength and weakness.  It absolutely gives the movie a unique narrative spine, however the least effective section is the last one, which doesn't exactly send the audience out of the film on the highest of notes.  The first two sections feel like they're building towards something, but the third section just sort of fizzles out (for me, anyway); where the first two acts are psychologically rich and complex, the third act feels a bit more obvious and conventional.  That's not enough to mar MOONLIGHT as a whole, but it does keep it from being among the very best movies of 2016.
All hype, over done artsy cinematography, and cliched story.
Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be so good.
While I can't say I loved this movie like everyone else did, this is still a remarkably crafted film into this young boys change in life and understanding of who he is. What I really like about is it feels like a genuine personal story about a young man living the harsh realities in a rough urban neighborhood. It is very well crafted and  every actor in this movie does a great job at playing their roles.
It didn't feel like a movie which made it more appealing to me.
A quiet moving little film. Very minimalistic type of movie, yet very powerful.
one way speakers are great on internet when trying to focus on movies on a laptop
very entertaining. you're always waiting to see what will happen next in this young mans life.
A wonderfully made film with no bad scenes, telling a compelling story that feels true.
Well deserved Golden Globe
Slow and depressing.
Wow... what a powerful movie... I was so moved by the pacing and story telling. I believe this movie is the best picture of the year.
one of the best movies of the year!!!
moonlight had to sit with me a while. but in the end, it offers a wonderfully acted, well scripted, look at something I had never experienced.  bravo.
a fucking masterpiece.
This poetic film that chronicles three stages in the life of a black kid (eventually teen and adult in each respective chapter) who struggles in his coming of age, dealing with his addict mother as well as his own sexual identity.  It's a well made, and subtle, film that grapples with it's subject matter with maturity and beauty and sorrow.
Extraordinary.  Emotional.
it left tears in my eyes---of boredom.
Masterpiece. A gorgeous masterpiece. I was floored by this magnificent work of cinema. Barry Jenkins is a master of his craft, and the three actors portraying Chiron were superb. Jenkins created a film straight out of a film studies class. His use of intense and very specific detail told the story. There was no excessive dialog needed, there was no beating you over the head with exposition, there was just pure, honest, storytelling. Jenkins' ability to tell a story that was so genuine is something that I crave in good cinema. It falls in a similar vein to movies like Blue Is the Warmest Color, in which it just shows a life in its most sincere form. I was blown away, and I adored every moment of it.
A big contender for the 2017 Best Film Oscar Award and next to La La Land the most overrated in this category!  In fact it was the least favourite of all the films nominated in this category!  Disjointed and partly confusing storyline with new characters popping up left right and centre only to disappear again a few min later for good!  Didn't really care for any of the characters in this film except perhaps Naomi Harris who should have gotten an Oscar nomination for her performance!
Film art at its finest. Unique , wonderful and thought provoking.
This is truly one of the greatest films ever made. That's a bold statement but it'sÂ deserving. It is perfection filmmaking by Barry Jenkins. The performances across the board where outstanding. Everyone's performance felt real and genuine. Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris really steal the show in the supporting cast along with Janelle MonÃ¡e. And as for the six actors who played Chiron and Kevin, kid, teen, or adult, they all were perfect. The film also had an amazing script, jaw dropping cinematography, and a haunting score. The characters were rich and complex and felt like they were real people. The film is filled with realism and often is very hard to watch but at the same time it is so captivating and you can't take your eyes off the screen. Even the little details were perfect. The lighting, sound mixing, editing, visual metaphors, and character details were so thought out and meaningful. The films plot is simple but effective. We've seen films where we watch the main character grow up in front of our eyes such as Boyhood but it's done with such class here that is gives off a completely fresh and new feel. The way the film is broken up into three chapters also gave it an interesting spin. The chapters are broken up nearly ten years apart so us the audience has to piece some things together in order to understand the development of the characters. The atmosphere also gives it this unique feeling. It's beautiful but very haunting and it really stays with you. Miami (where the film takes place) feels like a character. Not to mention the movie has not only a fantastic score but some of the best uses of music in any movie particularly during the third chapter which also has one of the best scenes in any film of the past decade. There are so many little nuances and things to talk about for hours after the viewing. On its surface it may not be relatable to many people but when you break it down it has something that anyone could grab onto. Whether you've had a tough time growing up, living in poverty, being homosexual, being bullied, not having a father figure, having a parent who is addicted to drugs, self discovery, becoming someone you're not, being different, covering yourself up, standing up for yourself, accepting forgiveness, or being a human being. This is a human story.Â It's absolutely mesmerizing. Beautiful, brilliant, poetic, sad but uplifting. It is perfect in length and never gets boring. It doesn't drag and ends leaving you asking questions and wanting more. Needing to experience it again. It's subject matter is important but it never tries to beat you over the head with it. It leaves you speechless. It does something that true art should do and that is leave you having discussions. MOONLIGHT is a MASTERPIECE. 

Score:10/10
A bit like American Beauty crossed with Boyhood in tone - but definitely its own thing. Really well made, shot, paced, and acted. Will linger with you a bit after its over. B+
This is one of those movies that will make you think for months after watching it. Proves that a solid story doesn't need a huge budget. It needs heart.
Homosexuality and masculinity are always subjects for debate. What makes a man? whats considered gay? is it not manly to be in touch with your femimine side? all kinds of questions arise when discussing these topics. Moonlight tackles these things but never before has it been done from the African American perspective. A uniquely crafted film that showcases impressive debuts from not just certain members of the cast but even from director Barry Jenkins himself.
	Chiron is the films main character and we see in three phases of his life, him dealing with his homosexuality. Chrion's life is rough and he learns major life lessons from a drug dealer and his girlfriend, his homie kevin at school and even in the harsh streets of his home in Miami. All of this occurs while he is also dealing with his crackhead mother who seemingly cares more about drugs than her own son.
One cannot sit in their seat and not find this film extremely  fascinating. this is a hood coming of age story and it is done so well by Jenkins. He gives you these real honest looks into the conflicting nature of both masculinity and homosexuality. an overall incredible directing job from barry Jenkins
the script is phenomenal. so many harsh and impactful life lessons are weaved into the story but at the end of the day the biggest element in here is identity knowing who you are and not letting someone determine that for you. The movie actually ends at a good point because by the end you sort of question if he has truly excepted who he is or not
chiron is such an intriguing character. he is an incredibly guarded kid and he speaks so little that when he does speak its like an event like this surreal moment because we don't learn a lot about him in one scene. The layers peal back only when he wants to and that is a testament to the storytelling ability of the 3 actors who played him. 
although I was surprised by the amount of time he is in the movie mahershala ali was superb in here as juan. Juan is a very unusual character and the last person you would think would be able to show promise of being a father figure and yet Ali makes him so believable and plays him so cool that we instantly see him as a good guy despite his immoral background. naomie harris gives an exceptionally compelling performance as this crackhead mama. She goes to deep and dark depths to showcase a woman that is cracking (no pun intended) day by day and is being less like a real mother figure that chiron needs in his life. Janelle Monae in her film debut was actually quite impressive and I really liked what she did with Teresa.
I was surprised by the music it was almost like listening to an actual ghetto opera or symphony. it brough a sense of authenticity to the movie and made for a mesmerizing tone for the movie. Great lighting work and the cinematography was fantastic.
Not much else needs to be said this is another strong contender at the oscars
Brilliant film. Exceptional Acting. Breathtaking Cinematography. Beautiful Music.
Beau, sensible et incroyablement bien joué. Un film essentiel.
I see why the academy chose this film as the best picture. At the same time, it feels the same as I have seen before in a coming of age film even with the main character being gay.
Film of the year? No, not by a long shot. But with strong performances across the board the film sheds light on a subject not often shown on the big screen.
One of those independent films that not only lives up to, but surpasses, its pre-release hype.
One of the best movies I saw this year.   Interesting characters that I haven't seen before.  Highly recommended.
Moonlight est le genre de film qui est bon Ã  la premiÃ¨re Ã©coute, but the more you think about it, the more it grows on you... Well I saw it last night et plus j'y pense, plus que la fin me brise le cÅ?ur. Ce n'est pas un film pour tout le monde... Mais Ã  tout les homophobes out There, si vous avez grandi comme des humains normaux et que vous avez un semblant d'empathie en vous, s'il vous plaÃ®t prenez le temps d'aller voir le film et voir l'impact que votre ignorance peut avoir sur la vie de certaines personnes. Moonlight n'est pas une romance, ce n'est pas une fiction, c'est un film vrai. Ã? tout ceux qui sont victimes d'intimidation, qui ont Ã©tÃ© rejetÃ© par leurs proches parce qu'ils Ã©taient diffÃ©rents, tout ceux qui ont fait semblant d'Ãªtre quelqu'un d'autre toute leur vie par peur de ne pas se faire accepter, je suis franchement dÃ©solÃ©.
I am calling this a hood classic already. It gives me a Boyz N tha Hood feel.
Moonlight is the movie we need right now. Depicting a black, gay man's journey throughout various phases of his life, Moonlight is piercingly human and intimate. It features several of the best performances of the year and rings with a genuine sense of the personal. It is a film that means a lot to those who made it and for those who will see it and while it isn't highly original and manages to hit the expected beats of a coming-of-age drama, Moonlight still radiates with authenticity and poetry alike. And Barry Jenkins, an FSU alumni at which I currently attend, directs with a calming, enveloping aura that draws viewers in immediately. It's Moonlight vs La La Land for that coveted Oscar as of now it's difficult to choose which I like more. Both so different, but excellent in their fields. For now, celebration is in order for a film that brings diversity, spotlight and attention to people who are often sidelined in todays cinematic realm. It's heartbreaking an uplifting and understated filmmaking. Rating: 91
The worst movie I saw from 2016 and I saw almost all of them. I don't care if it's some great "awards movie" in liberal Hollywood. The movie is just garbage. No, I don't need to see a guy jerking off another guy and rubbing his splooge all over the sand, but thanks! Thanks Moonlight! Great character development, too, I was shocked at how a young black boy in the ghetto growing up with a crack-addicted whore of a mother also grew up to be a drug dealer. What a crazy, crazy plot twist, I didn't see it coming at all! One of the most boring movies of all time and certainly one of the worst. It checks all of the boxes for the Social Justice Warriors: struggling gay black man with a crackwhore mother. What was the message? It's ok to be a gay black man who deals drugs? Uhh ok...?
Horribly boring. Apparently, this is what happens when a village is responsible for parenting...
The story is compelling, painting a picture of lives in struggle against strong themes. The musical score envelopes the story and brilliantly heightens the emotion of scenes. In spite these things and strong, gripping performances by the actors, the movie falls victim to itself and incredibly slow pacing.
A hauntingly beautiful movie... though not sure if it was Best Picture worthy.
Honestly, Moonlight is the best film of the year. Barry Jenkins pulls out all the stops in this mesmerising film about love and shame. I found myself barely blinking over the course of this film as it was so beautiful. Featuring stunning performances and an urban-classical score, Moonlight soars above its competition. It's not only tasteful and sensitive but it's also melancholic and wise. It's hard to fault Moonlight and in fact, it's possibly impossible to. Barry Jenkins ought to be proud for his artful production as Moonlight hits every chord perfectly.
La La Land got robbed. This movie is really just not that interesting.
One of the BEST films I've ever seen!
This is one of those movies that comes along every five to ten years that fires on all cylinders - script, cinematography, acting, soundtrack .... lots of heart, an incredible film. Can't recommend it enough
In no way did this deserve the Oscar for best picture or supporting actor! Very well made and excellent score but not Oscar worthy
Provocatively original and poetic!
Moonlight offers a special perspective on life. As I followed Chiron through the span of his life, I developed a close connection with the character. The acting of Little, Chiron, and Black was so powerful that I felt a lot of the struggles and emotional setbacks that the character felt. This movie showed me how dealing with sexuality is a part of life and sometimes it can be very confusing to people. I truly loved this film's direction, character development, plot, script, and musical score. There are not a lot of movies that leave me with the kind of indescribable feeling that Moonlight gave me, which is why I rate it 5/5 stars.
one of the absolute most beautiful and haunting films i've ever seen.
It's a beautiful story
Fascinating story. Beautiful acting. So wonderful to see good movies with strong stories, where everything isn't about special effects.
OOPs.guess who forgot to rate it... hach i went to see it with the only friend brave enough to go and see a "drama" ( I remeber distinctively people telling me they don't want to sth depressing)  and i also vividly recall how surprised we were at the movies uplifting and life-affirming message. The story is clear: It is the coming of age tale of a young black kid in a criminal neighbourhood in Miami and how different people and choices influenced him in becoming a person. The beaty about this tale however is, that at the end of the movie, the story is yet not finished and the viewer know, that the person has a new path ahead of him, thanks to a chance encounter with the love of his life whom he thought he had lost along the way . I loved the Idea that your childhood and teenage years may shape who you become, but that you still have the choice in your hand to change your life in poursuit of happiness. It is a true gem of a movie. The story sounds a bit like "Annie" meets "Precious", but the wonderful cinematography and the glorious, mostly classical score elevate the movie to a true paragon of its artform. The screenplay is understated, almost shy, giving the characters room to grow ( and grow gradually on the viewers too), which makes the third part of the movie also the most emotional and rewarding. You meet those characters as kids, you accompany them through joy and hardship, cringe when thy make mistakes and cry in the end when their emotions break loose. The greatness of "Moonlight" lies in the empathy the viewers develop while experiencing the life of a lonely, unsociable and awkward person, whose life goes gradually under your skin, while using dreamlike images and as little words as possible. The movie works like the mind of its protagonist: always esranged with the world, connecting only with few, , using words only when necessary and escaping the cruel reality by retreating (escaping) into his own inward world. 
While watching Moonlight, I had trouble believing that it was just a small Independent film. It felt like more, with so much poetry and beauty in a world that pop culture refers to as "Gangsters Paradise" . I personally think that this movie redefines completely the "Gangsta-Movie" genre by using its clichées and turning them into life choices and influences of a complex and troubed human being on his way to manhood. One of the greatest movies ever!
This movie was OK. Slow moving. Lots of black screen, and flashing lights I could have done without. Subject matter we've seen before but with the fresh perspective of a black inner city child. The most rewarding scene is the one with Little, Juan and Theresa where Little comes to realize who is, and what Juan is, and how that impacts him. Great acting on that part of Mahershala Ali.
Very well made, but it slows down at times. B
In many ways a very brave film that shines a light on a story and an experience that I'm sure so many people share, but -- because of the suffocating pressures of society -- are afraid to tell.
A film with the bones of a familiar story, but the skin of something brand new. Moonlight is a flick with a thoughtful score and masterful acting, that entertains but loses its edge as it develops. What begins as a tale of self-discovery quickly turns into a brutal and singularly-focused romance, with self-discovery on the side.
What Moonlight achieves is both something different and familiar and amounts to nothing less than watching the birth of human identity on screen. The film chronicles three formative experiences at three different times of a man's life, each serving as its own one-act play examining our protagonist and his tortured sense of self. The results are breathtaking and deeply immersive, allowing the formation of a human being to take place before your eyes in such magnificent artistic strokes. This is a sensitive, sincere, beautiful movie that serves as an indie coming-of-age tale sliced into three significant parts. I was completely under its sway within ten minutes, finding its perceptive perspective and nuances to be convincingly naturalistic. I felt like I was watching a documentary of a young black man's life told with ferocious realism, or at least a loosely fictionalized version of a life informed by fully authentic personal experiences. It's a somewhat ineffable quality for slice-of-life movies but they live or die on whether the film carries an unforced sense of realism, telling larger truths with small details, each piece coming together to make the world and the character feel fully formed. Moonlight pulls you immediately into its orbit thanks to its authentic drama and observations.

The three segments compliment one another as they build toward a young black man's understanding of his homosexuality. We've seen movies before where characters undergo sexual awakenings and from gay perspectives; it's practically a cottage industry unto itself in independent film. However, rarely have we seen this story from people of color. The expectations of accepted masculinity are entrenched at a young age, where "Little" (Alex Hibbert) is chided by, among others, his own mother Paula (Naomie Harris) for the "swishy" way he walks. It goes without saying that being gay is not exactly widely accepted in the Miami projects of the 1980s. This conflict of what makes a man is wonderfully symbolized with Juan (Mahershala Ali), an unexpected father figure that takes "Little" under his wing along with his girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monae). The kid wants to know how he can know if he's gay because it's certainly something he doesn't want. Juan doesn't pressure the boy or make big speeches about what it means to be a young black man in America. Instead, he tries teaching him to accept himself and provides an alternative home that serves as a refuge during his mother's long absences and crack-withdrawal tirades. There's a lovely moment where Juan teaches "Little" how to swim, and it's touching in how recognizably father/son the activity is, how much trust is involved and vulnerability, and how the film doesn't need to oversell the subtext. Juan definitely becomes the father figure that Chiron lives up to for the rest of his life. This first segment is dominated by their relationship but also Juan's sense of responsibility. He's making a living through selling drugs, including to "Little"'s own mother. In a very memorable and heated moment, Paula angrily calls out Juan for thinking he would make a better parent given the moral culpability of his own actions to her habit.

The second segment zooms ahead to when Chiron (Ashton Sanders) is a teenager in high school and subjected to hostile bullying. The schoolyard taunts from his youth have morphed into something more ferocious and toxic, as a collection of bullies torments Chiron and looks to rob him of his personal connections to others. The central focus on the middle segment is about the growing relationship with Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), the childhood friend who Chrion crushes on. Their closeness takes a leap one fateful night that Chrion will always remember. It's an awakening and a confirmation of self, and it's only after having this fulfilling outlet cruelly taken from him that Chiron finally lashes out, with lifelong repercussions. It's an explosion we can see coming and one that feels fully set up. The second segment feels more familiar because of the age range and it's the one with the dawning of sexual realization, a story situation we've seen before. What elevates it is that it's a fairly direct carryover from the beginning segment, which means the personal issues have magnified for Chiron. His relationship with his mother has become even more frayed as he's grown, and what once was name-calling and questions over his maturation has become confirmed. Her addiction has become even stronger and she's harassing her own son for whatever meager money he's given from Teresa, his surrogate mother figure. Chiron is struggling to make sense of his feelings in an upbringing lacking support and clarity. You could examine the conclusion of this segment as an empathetic cautionary tale, as we see the years of abuse and measured choices that lead to that confrontation.

The final segment is where Moonlight transforms into a late blooming unrequited romance that should steal your heart if it's still functioning. "Black" (Trevanta Rhodes) is a fully-grown adult that has seemingly followed in the footsteps of Juan in a life of low-level crime. He's hardened both emotionally and physically. The muscles will provide an intimidation factor missing during his youth if anyone questions his sexual leanings. He's burrowed into himself and the role he feels he must accept, but all of that changes the instant he gets an apologetic and searching phone call from Kevin (Andre Holland). Now working as a chef at a diner, Kevin reaches out to his old friend though even he can't fully explain why. This reawakens "Black"'s longing and he works up the courage to travel back to Miami to surprise the friend who meant so much to him. Their reunion is treated like the culmination of a romance that you may not have realized had you completely. After two segments of setup and years apart, you may find yourself projecting your thoughts to the screen, trying to compel these two men together. It's an extended sequence that moves at a gradual pace, a fitting tempo for a character racked by insecurities and suppression. By going forward he's taking a big risk, putting himself out there, and we desperately hope "Black" finds a sense of support. It's the segment where "Black" finds resolution with the major conflicts that have defined his life, and the climax of the movie is a deeply tender moment where an emotionally reserved man reaches out to another and lets his firmly fixed guard down in the process.

I don't usually go into such a detailed plot synopsis with my reviews because I like to hit the basics and let the readers experience the story for themselves, but the pleasures and artistic triumphs of Moonlight are in how fully immersed and felt the movie becomes. By telling the story in three noteworthy sections, Moonlight provides an impressionistic statement about the formation of personal identity, specifically a young man growing up black and gay in a hostile environment to both. The movie also blows apart the argument made for 2014's Boyhood about how truly necessary it was to watch one young actor play the same part for 14 years. Here we have six different actors playing two different characters at three different points in time and the impact is no less great. Here is a movie that doesn't need a gimmick to have a larger emotional impact on its audience.

Director/co-writer Barry Jenkins has a marvelously fluid and natural feel for his camera, swinging around the parameters of a scene to make the world feel more charged with energy. Jenkins is a born filmmaker and knows how to squeeze the most out of his scenes with gorgeous cinematography and an eclectic musical score that feels traditional with classical orchestration like churning strings layered and rearranged into something arrestingly new and yet still personal. There aren't many overly stylized choices, rather Jenkins tells his story with uncommon poise and treats one man's life like an opera, like the greatest story never told on film, like a life of complexity worth the deep dive. There's a classical lyricism to the presentation that reminded me of the works of Todd Haynes (Carol). There's one scene where Paula is strung out on crack and finds her son in the middle of a joyous high. Her face fills the frame, absorbing all of Chiron's world, and her euphoria is inter-spliced with jarring speed ramps in editing, meant to convey the mania and peace that pumps through her veins in this fleeting moment. It's a stylistic device that isn't overplayed and has genuine purpose. Jenkins is restrained from self-indulgences and keeps every aspect focused on reflecting the inner life of his lead.

The very talented company of performers makes the movie even more powerful. Ali (Hidden Figures, Luke Cage) is creating serious awards buzz and it's deserving, though every actor in this movie is deserving of notoriety. Ali plays a man trying to do right by his own sense and he lets you see the troubles that wash over him. Should he insert himself into this young boy's life? Is he in a position to set an example? Ali has such paternal strength and tenderness while still displaying doubts and regret, hardly deifying this found father figure. Harris (Spectre) is wonderfully horrifying and heartbreaking in her role and has some big moments that convey her given completely into desperation. She's offended that others would deign replace her but does little to reclaim her title of mother and provider. Holland (Selma) has a world-weary smooth sense of wisdom to him, and his unassuming charisma helps unlock his friend's true feelings. The three actors who portray "Little"/Chiron/"Black" are each exceptional, giving different performances and interpretations, further supporting Jenkins' artistic thesis.

Moonlight is a beautiful film told with such delicate care and a resounding sense of authenticity and personal detail. It swallows you whole and leaves you with the impression of a human life observed with tenderness, intimacy, empathy, and grace. It's about the people and experiences that help guide us onto the paths we take, and while there's a sense of heartache as we think of what might have been, there's also the serenity of accepting what has been and what can still be. Jenkins proves himself a superb talent who doesn't lose sight of his artistic goals with extraneous artifice. There's a lilting, lovely lyricism to the movie that elevates Chiron's life into feeling like poetry. This is a life we so rarely get to see given such an artistic and honest examination without condemnation or judgment. It's the story of a man embracing his identity and overcoming isolation and suppression. This disadvantaged young man is worth your emotions, your sympathies, and your attention. Moonlight is an alluring and heartrending film that manages to be deeply personal and universal at the same time. It's sublime.

Nate's Grade: A
Wonderful. Artistic. ??
Moonlight is certainly a well-made character study and performance piece that thoroughly examines identity, development, and black culture but didn't personally resonate with me and as a result, I was neither invested in the characters or the story at hand. Moonlight will likely appeal to a wide audience who find common ground with the protagonist but the film's simply wasn't my cup of tea.  Feel free to check out the rest of my review at http://filmassessment.blogspot.com/2016/12/moonlight-review.html
It's a strange one, folks. But, it's also beautifully poignant, awkward, and real; an excellent take on how others impact our lives. Being different can be painful, and just like this movie, it can be hard to face at times. 

The three actors portraying the protagonist are perfect for the roles, and they aren't easy roles to play. It is hard to imagine how strange it must be to play such a quiet and moody character, much less have to match two others. The pace is somewhat slow, but consistent, which is hard to do and an interesting aspect of the film. 

While I loved the story, acting, and direction, the score really sold this movie. It is very understated, seemingly innocuous, but it really is the most powerful aspect of this film. I can only hope that it is not overlooked during awards season.
Well acted, slow, and sometimes hard to watch. 
Some weird experimental camera work that may give you motion sickness. Some pacing issues. Excellent directing
Finely crafted, and outstanding performances.
My thoughts are perfectly summed up by reviewer Mark Walker : "I got the message of Moonlight. I got what it was trying to say. I was even impressed with its artistic approach and it's seamless merging of three narratives. It's a story about connection, sexuality and masculinity. It's a universal tale about self-discovery. I didn't misunderstand it. What I don't understand is the praise that's been lavished upon it. This is, unequivocally, one of the most overrated films in quite some time. I'll give director Barry Jenkins his due, his deliberate approach to the material is impressive as it verges on european art-house. Some of his and cinematographer James Laxton's eye for a shot can be striking but, in the end, the film meanders and finds it very difficult to steer clear of contrivance. Frankly, the film takes far too long to say anything. Tedium sets in very quickly and by the time the film reaches its final third, it dawns on you that all you're really getting from this is pretentious twaddle."
A movie that transcends any genre - Moonlight is rare for its gentle and unforgiving treatment on a gentle and unforgiving world. Nothing is black or white, and we are all blue in the moonlight. This is filmmaking with no sense of the flimmaking or filmmaker... it's not flashy, it's not ego-driven or preachy, it just quietly unfolds in front of you, as if, like a ghost, you've been allowed full access to a life which you otherwise may have no connection too; but at the same time, who hasn't felt the struggle to conform to a world with crushing hardships and rigid rules. We may come from a world far different than the one Chiron inhabits, but our struggles for fully-realized personhood are the same.  This movie is rare and beautiful and quiet. It invites compassionate observation not charitable  judgement, and that is why it sings.
This movie was a critic's dream! solid storyline provoking thoughts and bringing you to question your views on the struggles of the inner city. To the average viewer you might not be as drawn in but I definitely feel it is a must watch. Its is not your typical "making it in the hood movie"
I really didn't know much about the story of this film going in, I had only heard great things about the film so gave it a shot.  It was nice not knowing just discovering the story.  Barry Jenkins who wrote and directed this movie is a real talent.  The actor Mahershala Ali is absolutely fantastic and should win the best Supporting Actor Oscar in my opinion.  I also like the score and use of music as well.  The movie lost a little momentum in the 2nd act for me, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  Definitely a must watch for film lovers though!
A powerful, well acted film that is definitely worth checking out. The 3rd act didn't quite connect for me like the first two did, but admittedly it's hard to top the first section here.
The way that this film is structured is fantastic and the thematic elements are powerful in addition to the performances. Marhershali Ali provides a significant impact throughout the entire film and the young actors portraying the main character bring real life and emotion to to the story of the protagonist. The directing here is unmatched by Barry Jenkins and who manages to triggering emotions without explicitly telling you how to feel. The third act doesn't come as impactful as I had hoped but there is truly magnificent work here.

Rey's Rate: 9.0/10
Not what I was expecting at all. A more compelling romance than LaLaLand though.
Beautiful, must watch movie!! Great performance by the cast. A+ ??
****
'Moonlight' is beautiful, poignant, heart wrenching, and surprisingly thought-provoking. Many of us can relate to at least one aspect of Chiron's story, and I think that's what makes him such a captivating case study. As brilliant as the writing is, words mean nothing without good actors - and my oh my does this movie have some good performances. Everybody is absolutely perfect in their roles, and Writer/Director Barry Jenkins' fascinating direction makes the events taking place even more enthralling. The film may run a little too long, and ever so slightly drag in certain places, but these are mere nitpicks. This is a movie that must be seen.
Beautiful, moving film.  Nothing else I have seen is really like this film.
An emotional film that will tug at the heart.  a movie about people struggling to define themselves. Power house performances that will tug at your heart and leave you crying.
Great directing, cinematography, and acting but still not enough for me to give this a fresh review. Their are so many agendas they are trying to shove down your throat that it takes away from the story.
Just another "black struggles" film.
Unflinching portrayal of a young African-American boy coming to grips with his sexuality amidst challenging circumstances. While thoughtful and introspective, it's a bit slow at times and sometimes overplays its indie card.
A beautiful story brought to life. Each chapter representing a decade of life. The character, Chiron (so relatable) easily depicts the life of being a black man in America. To always be tough and hyper masculine. A father figure who is nonetheless, a gem himself. Not judging or harshly hurting the child for being who he wants.  A mother struggling with addiction who happens to find requiem towards the end. A young man with an internal struggle with his sexuality. Each story all intertwines into a beautifulf cinematic masterpiece known as "Moonlight".
a bit overated La La Land should have won best picture.
A visually beautiful movie that is very intense and powerful. It touches on a lot of serious issues such as drug use, violence and sexuality. This film had excellent character development and got me very emotional at the end when Cirone goes to visit his mom in rehab. A must watch!
A well-made movie with good performances and tells a story not often seen on film.
Overrated.  Can't relate, story drags.  It just a combination of Boyhood and Brokeback Mountain
Awesome. I cried half the time!
The visual flavor is not like other motion pictures you have seen. Everything about the camerawork is flawed: the image jerks all over, the image spins in and out of focus, the white balance is off, but you know what? It works. If done unintentionally, this would appear to be the work of any amateur who's never touched a camera before. But director of photography James Laxton orchestrates these imperfections to match the disorder of Chiron's desire for self-discovery. Nicholas Brittel's (The Big Short) soundtrack matches the troubling look of the picture to help you hate the people that Chiron would want dead.
Beautiful film that gets better the more you reflect on Chiron's life and personalize his journey. There are moments and people in our lives that, however fleeting there existences may be, take us on paths that we did not anticipate, sometimes taking further and sometimes closer to whom we are at our cores. This journey to self-knowledge, inner peace and love is not to be missed.
The film assembles its character portrait of woe very well and very efficiently, with Jenkins and his cinematographer James Laxton showing a love for moving their camera through busy scenes in a single take. Yet Chiron's journey becomes slowly overwhelmed by the film's swelling sense of self-importance. We're meant to read great profundity into every pregnant pause and depressing turn, as though the issues of troubled black urban youths are being raised on film for the first time. It becomes very tedious very quickly. And, frankly, "Moonlight" simply runs out of puff, with too little in the film's final chapter to drive it home to a closure that is dramatically satisfying. While "La La Land" isn't the pinnacle of originality, obviously, "Moonlight" felt unoriginal and at times pretentious. Not the Best Picture.
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE I SAW IN MY LIFETIME.
A beautifulyl filmed movie capturing the essence of humanity
A profound example of character-driven cinema, fully invested in inclusive casting and telling the stories we are all yearning to know in a full way. Moonlight is the beginning. And Chiron's story is one we need to know.
Moonlight is one of those rare films that washes over you with its truth and beauty; a cinematic experience that expands your love, understanding and empathy for others. With remarkable performances and award worthy direction and cinematography, this is one of the best films of 2016. If this film is playing in your city be sure to seek it out!
omg I loved this movie sooo short it felt like I loved it overall I wish they had more of his passed and more as a whole ended off on a HUGE cliff hanger which sucked a little but finding him having peace at mind for a couple seconds at the end really puts the movie up there my favorite part was at the pricipals office at mid age when he said you don't understand that alone brought a tear to my eyes because being a boy not that it matters but being a troubled kid meaning I threw fits all the way threw 8th grade and below and just recently matured to average at least at 9th because no one really understood what it felt to be billed and for you to do something but get in trouble for it I cried a few tears all I have to say is that I watched it in the theaters 3 times and still want more cant wait for a moonlight 2 anyone else /??
I was expected some kind of dismal sadness to show up in a heart wrenching way, but NO, I was taken on the best (realistic) valuable non-dramatic story ride of my life.  Thank you to the director, writer, and fabulous actors for this gem.  Made my otherwise crappy year, a bit more decent.  <3
What an amazing story! Great characters, acting, and writing!!
This movie follows a young boy who is black and also discovers he is gay as he finds his way in a low income world. His struggles are many and sometime very complicate (as is life) but not without support and love. I could have use subtitles in several places, and others in the audience agreed. BUt it is a lovely, slowly developing story. I'm not sure why it is being considered as an Oscar sweep, although I can see many nominations possible. BUt if you are looking for a movie about angst, this is one to consider.
(Overdue post | Congratulations for winning Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay)

Moonlight is a triumph, not only for its unique narrative development, rather its realistic qualities from its characters, themes, and environment that all individuals can identify with. 

This is a story of a young man's struggle to find himself and is told across three chapters in his life as he discovers the joy and pain of life and love, while grappling with his own sexuality. Three talented actors play the role of our protagonist, Chiron, in different times of his life. The talent of the three actors extend to their overall ability to blend to Chiron, making sure we never doubt that we're watching the same character in different segments of his life. There are some supporting characters that venture along with Chiron in those three chapters, which is life-like, as there are different people in a person's life that come and go. Moonlight seems like a homage to the malevolence and goodwill of the many people in our life that make us who we are.

Though the specifics of Chiron's life and environment as a young black man will be foreign to many, Moonlight addresses universal issues such as bullying, drug abuse, sexual identity, and the journey to adolescence that are identified by individuals across the world. 

Overall, Moonlight boasts honest dialogue and dramatization complemented with an emotional score and visual style that is sure to stir you.
Absolutely incredible. As a teacher in South Central LA, this film resonated deeply and made me reflect on the possible experiences my young men of color struggle with constantly in their life. Beautiful music score, amazing all-Black cast, absolutely incredible.
First two parts were absolutely amazing but the last part did slow down a bit, but still incredible.
AMAZING triptych of young man surviving drug-addicted mother & discovering his sexuality. Great acting, directing, writing
Moonlight is a spectacular coming of age picture. The soundtrack fits the film and the cinematography is beautiful. Barry Jenkins' long takes are awe-inspiring. The performances are thrilling, all three lads that play Chiron are believable in the stage of his life that they are showing us. Naomi Harris is a different person to what I've ever seen her in. I also really liked Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monáe, who has really made 2016 her breakthrough year, as well as everybody else. This wasn't necessarily relatable for me but I feel that if I was a gay black man, this would really resonate with me.
Well, that was certainly unexpected.

"Moonlight" is a beautiful, simple film chronicling the life of a black boy, teenager, and man named Chiron.  Growing up alone, with a crack-addicted mother and no father, Chiron - or "Little" (Alex R. Hibbert) as he is called as a boy - finds himself adopting make-shift parents.  "Teresa" (Janelle Monae) has the nurturing skills Chiron's mother, "Paula" (Naomie Harris) lacks.  She takes an immediate liking to the boy, despite the fact that he will barely say more than three words at a time.  More powerful, though, is the relationship Chiron has with "Juan" (Mahershala Ali).  Juan is a drug dealer, who finds Chiron in an abandoned house where he hides from the neighborhood bullies.  Juan also happens to be the man who supplies Chiron's mother with drugs, a fact that provides internal conflict for all involved.  That's not the only internal conflict, though, as Chiron - even at a very early age - knows he is different than the other boys.  In a heartbreaking scene, he asks Teresa and Juan about it; I was in tears.

Eventually, Chiron becomes a teenager (Ashton Sanders).  He's still quiet and now even more awkward.  He is constantly picked on, specifically by a boy named "Terell" (Patrick Decile) for no other reason than Chiron seems like an easy target.  Things aren't completely bleak, though, as Teresa is still ever-present in Chiron's life.  And he does have a friend in "Kevin" (Jharrel Jerome).  They have a complicated relationship.  There's betrayal, which causes Chiron to go on the offensive.  His life is forever changed.

We meet him many years later, now a man who goes by "Black" (Travante Rhodes), living in Atlanta, working the drug trade.  He's done time, he's no longer "soft;" but he's still awkward, quiet, and he's still very much Chiron. When he gets a phone call from Kevin (Andre Holland), now a cook at a diner back in Miami.  He goes to visit his mother and stops by to see his old friend.  The sexual tension rivals anything I've ever seen.

I cannot get over the simplicity and straightforwardness of this authentic coming of age tale.  And I definitely cannot believe how amazing the acting is, especially by the three actors who play Chiron.  While each embodies the character differently, the way you would expect based on their phase of life and their life experiences, there is a commonality among all three performances that is magnificent.

This very well might be the best movie of the year.

Good luck finding it outside of independent art houses; but if you can locate it, run - don't walk - to see this movie today.
Poignant and tragic show. Very artistic- with key scenes subbing music for dialogue. Excellent casting - especially the 3 different actors that poetry Chiron and Kevin.
Moonlight delivers an intense but remarkable journey through a man's life story and all the harsh trouble he had to deal with, family dilemmas, gang violence, law enforcement, etc., it's one of the year's best and a movie that'll crank up your emotions and make you think!

I don't understand how this won Best Picture. It's really slow and boring. You don't really care about the characters. Pretty hard to ever rewatch again.
Finally a simple story told with cinematic vitality, originality and vigor. In a just world, it should mop the floor with the rest of the nominations.
ok life story, but not much happens
The emperors new clothes.
Not sure how it received a high rating.
The movie was slow from beginning to end and all over the place.
2.5/5 stars.  This movie told an important story, but I'm not sure it translated that well from the play to the film.  It was very slow and just when a storyline would pick up and get interesting, then the plot would shift to a new time period and slow down to a crawl again.
excellent film. wonderful and poignant performances. got me thinking a lot about my experiences and those of my friends.
Personal, dramatic filmmaking in its purest form. The entire film hinges on the performances of just a few people, and they more than deliver. If acting-based filmmaking is a thrill for you, there's a lot to like here. If you prefer fast-paced stories and action set-pieces you'll probably get bored.
A movie about life, growing up, but above all, defining yourself. It revolves around what Juan says : "At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you."
Uplifting! I enjoyed the pacing of the movie and felt refreshed after it. It makes a timely end of the year movie because I got to see Chiron (lead, coming of age) grow up.
This is a movie that deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Such a beautiful, heartbreaking, stunning character study, told in three acts by three wonderful actors. The cast is stunning in that it doesn't feel like they're acting at all, the visuals and sound design are top-notch, and this is a well-directed and well-written work of art. I don't want to say too much about it because it is a must see, but I teared up and related to a lot of the film's themes of masculinity, sexuality, and growing up different. A perfect film.
Excellent it felt " real" great acting took the viewer inside emotionally to the characters
Meh. Slow moving and never seems to climax.
Masterpiece; this movie should be  watched by anyone who is ready to witness the ultimate coming of age story and get a glimpse of a person developing into ones self despite endurimg difficulties and adversities and hypermasculinity in Liberty City, Miami. Take your friends, tell co-workers, even call Kim Burrell to take her church members to see this movie. Powerful!
This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters were all memorable, the acting & performances were outstanding & all three actors that portrayed the main character Chiron were great, Chiron himself is a great main character and many can relate in some way in what he goes through in life. Every second of film was enjoyable & I was always invested in every bit of the movie and what was going to happen next. All three acts were equally great. I can't think of any mistakes or anything that I didn't like in this film. Very underrated & well made film, I would recommend that everybody should see it if they have the chance. 10/10 (5/5 Stars). On the level of La La Land or The Nice Guys.
This movie sucked. boring as hell
A visual, poetic etude beautifully told in 3 parts; telling the story of a young man's struggles as he negotiates his way through life. 
Dealing with culture, class, society and sexuality with eloquence.
Trevante Rhodes as Black, and Mahershala Ali as Juan, powerfully convey their character's contradictions. Naomi Harris and Janelle Monae (in a surprising turn) heartbreakingly represent 2 ends of a spectrum as Chiron's support system.
I think this has been slightly over praised because of its subject matter. Its a little unfocused and a little "European". For example a main character seems to disappear with out much mention. Also its hard to really invest in a main character who says almost nothing. The cinematography is good but uneven and jumps around in style for no apparent reason. This does have some nice moments and is worth a  watch.
just amazing. I can't put in to words how great of a movie this is
This movie did NOT live up too all the hype! I think the critics are overcompensating for last year's hollywood blacklist BS. The story line was interesting and the acting was great! Just when, you think something interesting might happen....it doesn't. The all so important father figure dies and you don't know how or why? It is never explained. This movie has huge gaps that are never filled. There were three different actors for "Little" the first two looked alike but the last one looked nothing like the first two. It completely threw me off. So, "Little" and Kevin have a brief  sexual relationship and a decade later Later he claims no one has ever touched him before besides Kevin. This is not realistic people move on. I really tried with this Movie it just wasn't that interesting and playing classical music and starring in the mirror doesn't make a film artistic.
One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. It is a complete shame it did as poorly as it has in the theaters but it is no surprise America has never taken an interest to the urban struggle and the gay struggle. This movie does an amazing job of giving you a different perspective of regular people cought in bad situations dealing with real controversy only in the end to find like anyone else life is about being with the people who celebrate who you really are and not letting the world's labels rule your life. Seriously intellectual messages here if you pay attention.
Masterpiece. Stirring. Brilliant. Remarkable. Needed. There are thousands of words to describe the artwork that is Moonlight, but somehow it left me speechless when the credits rolled. Barry Jenkins created a picture that the world needed now more than we ever did. A perfect display of love and heartache, that hit every nerve in my body. The writing, the cinematography, the camerawork, the acting.... There was not a weak link to be found in this film. Simply, and utterly perfection.
Moonlight is a great movie and One of the best  movies I've seen all year, it's got great performances, great acting, a fantastic Scrip and story, and a score that is almost haunting and beautiful, moonlight is a perfectly executed character study of a young man discovering is homosexuality and himself in a way, there's so many great things about it, all the actors involved in this movie we're very invested in what role they were playing and what characters they were playing and own it, all the actors in the movie give the best performances I've seen all year, even the three actors who played Shyrone the main character in this movie do a fantastic job, mostly the film is really strung together by all the fantastic performances, if you're an aspiring writer then watch this movie and take notes, cause that's how you wright great characters, the only problem I have with the movie is the dream sequences in the movie but they weren't bad at all it's just an artistic decision I didn't agree with, it isn't an epic film that changed my life in any way, but for what it is, it's very very well done, it's the best character study that we have seen in years, it's basically personal preference for me giving it a 10/10, for me personally, it's a 9/10
Insightful, touching and deeply moving, "Moonlight" is a powerful coming-of-age drama that raises issues that are too often ignored in society today.
Moonlight is a tender exploration of sexuality and self-acceptance. A parable of life in underprivileged ghettos of society, told with the upmost delicacy and respect. Whilst Moonlight focuses on the American working class black community, it's moral theme of cyclical self-depreciation and desperation could be retold in any home devoid of love or community lacking hope. Given the subject matter Moonlight could have been an arduously grim experience. However Jenkins crafts Moonlight masterfully, punctuating the bleak storyline with sumptuous cinematography and a juxtaposing classical score. Told through three snapshots of Chiron's coming of age, a uniformly superb cast keep us engaged. Part of the viewers frustration at Chiron is that he misses the glimmers of hope - such as the tender hearted acceptance of Juan and Teresa - and concludes with a touching optimism that his future may lead him down a more satisfying path. Whilst it's far from the stereotypical Oscar winner chock full of barn-storming dramatics and elongated "nomination bait" speeches, Moonlight's subtlety sticks with you. A brave tale told in a bold and unique manner.
Fascinating, complex
"Moonlight" takes a subject that at first seems familiar, but it spins a fresh web around it.  The film brilliantly shows how we are products of our environment and though we change physically over the years we remain that same person at our core. Certainly one of 2016's shining moments.
A whole lot of buildup to absolutely nothing. Competently made, flatly delivered.
Powerful cinematography and character-building throughout. Films displaying the core of human nature, alongisde dual emotions of fear and passion, of this caliber are far and few between.
I'm not sure how Jenkins pulls it off, but he tells the story of two men over three different periods of their life with completely different actors who are certifiably credible throughout. It's not through simple gestures, and certainly not resemblance. I guess it's the heart that runs through our hero's life -- torn asunder between the demands of the street in a rough Miami neighborhood populated by other black men more macho than he is -- and his big secret, that he loves the men more than the ladies. We learn it all in highly polished, gem-like scenes, one following another as we learn the tough lessons of survival, and catch glimpses of hope and maybe another way. I loved this movie, I loved that its singular beauty and soul is being acknowledged. I loved that we can have "gay" movies in which the sexual part is neither hidden nor dominant -- like all of us, it's a very important, but only one aspect of a rich and complicated life that's hard for everybody, especially when you're poor and black.
Like Manchester by the Sea this is a well done movie that is increditably depressing.  I am depressed enough by the election but if you need more to view the world in dark terms indeed go to this movie.
Gritty, compassionate, beautiful, very moving and oh, so existential.
A very powerful film. Subtle moments in life, but each one can tell a story. Moonlight follows a man in three stages in life living in Miami and dealing with his crack head mom Paula (Naomie Harris) and also with realizing that he's gay. As a young boy known as Little (Alex Hibbert) he is befriended by a drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who brings Little into his life and treats him fairly and becoming a father figure to him along with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). These are easily some of the most powerful scenes early on. Seeing Little and Juan bonding and Juan being a super tough guy breaking down and showing his true side to Little. The second stage is when Little goes by his real name Chiron (Ashton Sanders) in High School. He's picked on for being super poor and called named. His friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) seems to be the only person that treats him kindly along with Theresa. This stage is the heaviest because Chiron realizes who he is, but after a series of events runs away from his true self. The last stage is were Chiron goes by the name Black (Trevante Rhodes) now in his mid twenties he is a completely physically transformed man. He's a drug dealer that doesn't show his true self to anyone until one night he gets a call from Kevin (Andre Holland) and decides to drive down to Miami to meet up with his old friend. Fantastic performances here. From the three main leads who represent Chiron during his different stages of life (9, 16 and 26) they all show the evolution of the character and how things have affected him at each level. When he is called Black at this stage where he is a physically imposing person, but still hurting inside it can be a huge talk about how masculinity in men can sometimes be a defense to hide against what they may really be like, or feeling. It's a great film and the one quirk I had was how quick it ends. I wanted to get a little more closure, but still it was a great watch! Give this one a look!
Una historia dura, cruel y tristemente cotidiana. Tiene todo: un buen guion, gran direccion y extraordinarios actores que se desempeñan de una forma unica. Lastima que el final se queda un tanto corto para la gran historia que se desarrolla a lo largo de la pelicula pero no le quita el valor y el buen trabajo hecho en ella. Los 3 actores que interpretan a Chiron en las 3 etapas de su vida saben transmitir al espectador la tristeza y el dolor que esconde el personaje. De verdad que vale la pena verla
Poetic filmmaking about a demographic of people living in America whose stories wildly go untold.
this is not a good movie; one the worst ones I have seen lately; almost as bad as Jason Bourne.
And the oscar goes to Marshala Ali.  And give one to the kid as well.
'Moonlight' is illuminating

Moonlight is a self contained story about the life of a young man as he grows up in Miami, Florida. He has many of the problems we see in other films about boys and girls growing up, but it is not a coming of age story in the traditional sense. 

The main character goes by various names in the film: Little, Black and his given name, Chiron. He's little compared to his contemporaries, and he is bullied for his quiet demeanor. 

The transitions from Little to Black to Chiron work well. The film expresses genuine emotion through the main character's struggles. The film touches on the themes of living poor, being black and being gay, but it is above all a character study about Chiron who happens to grow up gay, poor and black. No grand statements are made about identities, just about him. I can't think of anything that comes across and phony. 

Rating: Pay full price. While not perfect, it's authentic and emotionally appealing. That's more than we can say about most films this year. 

Peace,

IFJA members issued this statement for the Hoosier Award: "Andrew Cohn cements his place as an important filmmaker by becoming the first two-time recipient of the Hoosier Award. (He previously shared the 2013 prize for another documentary set in Indiana, "Medora.") His new film perceptively follows the journeys of three Indianapolis adults trying to obtain their high school diploma while at different stages in life, even as they juggle the challenges of poverty, crime and low expectations. Cohn is clearly dedicated to exploring the plight of everyday Hoosiers whose struggles are happening right before our eyes, but somehow out of sight."

Engrossing at every turn
Excellent acting, very sensitive and intense.  Having said that, I wasn't drawn into the film.  Not enough depth of character development.
Best movie of the year.
Moonlight was written and directed by Barry Jenkins and depicts the story of a boy named Chiron in three different times of his life: his childhood, his teen years, and his adult life. A black kid growing up in a tough Miami neighborhood, Chiron struggles through many challenges in regards to drugs, his race, and his sexuality.

Any good movie needs a good story, and Moonlight delivers in this regard. If I had to explain it to somebody who hadn't heard of it, I'd say it's a mix of Boyhood and Brokeback Mountain. There is so much brutally honest storytelling throughout each of the three acts to the point where I felt completely invested in Chiron's life and struggles. The grounded story is paralleled by the cinematography - I think the indie-budget really helped from an artistic perspective. Every performance is solid. I especially liked Mahershala Ali (House of Cards, Luke Cage) in this movie as a drug dealer. The three different actors who played Chiron did a great job maintaining the character's personality traits throughout each stage as well.

My gripes with Moonlight are really minor things. In the second act, there is a plot device that really felt out of place concerning Kevin and a game. For a brief moment, that took me out of the moment, but the resulting effect pulled me right back in. Also, the creative decision behind the ending didn't sit well with me. Throughout the movie, Jenkins' direction kept everything clear, precise, and direct. He didn't feel the need to embellish any scene, which I loved. However, this made the final scene feel somewhat dry and anticlimactic. Again, I understand why it ended in this way, but the payoff just wasn't what I wanted it to be. I know, this is a picky complaint.

In the end, Moonlight has a unique and important story to tell and brings up issues we haven't seen in the film industry before. If you are intrigued by the premise and have patience with how a movie develops, definitely go give this a watch. Casual movie fans probably won't find much enjoyment here.

Final grade: B+

I really looked forward to this movie... did not enjoy like I thought I would
Excellent movie; beautifully shot and directed; very realistic tableau of poverty. I'm also writing this review so I can find myself in the Flixster database...
absolutely incredible
This film is perfect.
Well acted, emotional film.
Great cinematography with deep emotional story. Unexpected moments throughout the movie with very good acting.
heartwrenchingly good
Moonlight delivers a slow, saddening portrayal of the marginalized and those left confused in their search for identity.
A very slow moving coming of age movie, broken up in three segments of one boy's/man's life. Some good acting, but I am surprised that this movie is recommended by a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes & the golden globes!
This is a slow burn. It's pacing and mood is unique and patient. Every performance is careful and polished, which is really a statement about the film as a whole. I really enjoyed this movie and was super impressed with the score and the music selection. 

"Moonlight" is an incredible juxtaposition and story-cocktail of the African-American urban culture up and the struggles of a young homosexual male.
Movie was excellent.  Great acting. Touching. Sad. LIfe is long. People change. People touch you and shape you, your experiences shape you. Sort of Brokeback Mountain meets Boyhood.
Okay, not as great as everyone says in my opinion. 
Long. Stereotypical. Unbelievable.
Unbelievably empathetic and soulful film that follows one young man from a childhood in urban Miami, troubled teenage years of questioning sexuality, to adulthood of regret and a questionable place in the world. Painted in beautiful purples and blues and showing a side of Miami rarely scene. Featuring a trio of performances that sell the connective tissue of the film. Barry Jenkins has created a can't miss film.
This film includes good direction, scoring and cinematography, and stand out performances by Naomi Harris and Ashton Sanders. Despite all of that, and it's relevant and "important" subject matter, it is still the movie equivalent of Rohypnol and left no impression on me at all. The bullying scenes were a little too "after-school special" and fake, and its snail-like pace really tests the audience. This film will get faux love, genuine love, faux criticism and genuine criticism, so it may be hard to determine if you should go see it. I say, unless you have a particular interest, save your time and money. Lastly, fuck Oscars and their constant insistence of awarding political correctness instead of pure art and movie magic. #LaLaLandteam
A realistic eye opening view on the life in the inner city and how you're treated if you're different.
Very much wanted to like this movie but found it borderline boring and predictable with rough segues as protagonist finally comes of age. Can't fathom why it's scooping up awards. One of those overwrought indies critics like, maybe, but the filmmaking should be at a higher level.
Film of the year. It better win some film of the year award. I can't fathom why it wouldn't. So touching, so real, necessary to our society
It has "Sundance Movie" written all over it, which means it has great little moments that are touching and effective, but that's about it. The directing is unfocused and disorienting, servicing the moment rather than the narrative as a whole; the storytelling device is interesting but cuts all tension just when it's becoming truly relevant; and it's hard to ignore how gimmicky some scenes are.
Beautiful in each breath and true in each blow.
Uncomfortable, unnerving, inquisitive.  Particularly interesting in the way the story was told. Casting was pretty remarkable in that they were able to seamlessly tell the story while it always felt like the same person. Let's the audience find the answers on their own while leaving subtle enough clues that the payoff is still worth while. Felt like a lot of subject matter shoehorned in all at once.
There are good poetic moments, but this is one of those films that doesn't bold on me
There are so many good things to say about this film. I can't remember ever seeing a film that has characters so well drawn across multiple actors (the main character is played by 3 different actors for 3 different times of his life). Although I found his (Chiron) lack of communication frustrating at times, I felt it really worked for the film. I also really liked getting to know a life that is so different from my own.
As sophomore efforts are concerned, director Barry Jenkins' 2016 Moonlight is a fine effort of vision, craft and the perfect next step to go into. His first film, the modest Before Sunrise-esque 2008 Medicine for Melancholy, established a unique voice that was not afraid to address topical issues and with Moonlight-a decades spanning glimpse into the life of an African-American growing up from young boy to an adult-is audacious in scope, anchored by good performances (Mahershala Ali stands out) and executed with the utmost of sincerity. With a three-act structure that is somewhat similar to 2013s The Place Beyond The Pines, the outline of the story is unique and adds a theatrical element to an otherwise very human tale about societal norms, being an outcast and becoming the person that one can become. While Jenkins (who wrote the screenplay) and Tarell Alvin McCraney (who conceived of the story) truly create a unique approach to things, sections that fuel the drama have been played out before and parts do dip into melodrama. These things never derail Moonlight but they do hold back the film from becoming something truly special.
-incredible performances across the board.  Particularly moved by Ashton Sanders performance as Chiron during awkward teen years.   So much empathy for him during that time.  Unique story although parallels to 2011's Pariah.  Handled with elegance and subtlety.  Initially wished Black felt that Kevin was "a long lost love" relationship, but upon further thought that would have been hackneyed.  More more powerful that Kevin simply represents the only true moment of affection that Little, Chrion, Black has ever experienced...that he's had to hold back/hide all that he wants to be except for during that one fateful evening on the beach.  3 chapters/acts transitioned well and handled in a way that it was easy to fill in the blanks.
-Was not the life-changing experience that others seem to be having with the film.  Emotional impact was not overwhelming.  Might have liked a little more reflection on Juan's impact on his life although there was that nostalgic moment looking at the beach in the third chapter that harkened back to when Juan taught Little to swim.  Not sure the cinematography is so well done as to merit the recognition it's getting.  The circling camera has been done a million times and felt a little contrived here.
-100% sell on reviews, uniqueness of story, and that it might have a lasting impact on the viewer...WOM should support all of the above.
heart breaking and moving
The most phenomenal movie in years.
I find the whole premise very interesting but I felt not much happened. The movie felt a bit bland to me. However, the acting is really good, especially that of Mahershala Ali. I give this movie 8/10
An absolute Masterpiece. Nothing quite like it, and without a doubt the most important film of 2016.
A great, deeply human film that shows a side of black masculinity we rarely see in film. And a side of male friendship we rarely see on the screen, outside the comedy genre.
Powerful, vulnerable, beautiful. Love, acceptance, & sense of belonging are universal but does not have one path. Directing, cinematography, and acting are world-class. The actors who portrayed the main protagonist did an incredible job of threading the essence of the person in these three vignettes.

"I've been here a long time. Out of Cuba. A lot of black folks are Cuban. You wouldn't know from being here now. I was a wild little shortie, man. Just like you. Running around with no shoes on, the moon was out. This one time, I run by this old... this old lady. I was running, howling. Kinda of a fool, boy. This old lady, she stopped me. She said... [imitates old lady voice] "Running around, fishing in a boat of light. In moonlight, black boys look blue. You're blue. That's what I'm gonna call you: 'Blue'.""
Chiron would ask him afterwards if that's what they called him, 'Blue' to which Juan replied, almost reminiscently, 'no.' It is this small story which builds the foundation of the sound, the color, the feeling, of what young Chiron feels throughout his life.

   Moonlight tells the story of Chiron, a boy growing into manhood in the humid and harsh streets of urban Miami. Those same streets descend on his family leaving Chiron without a father and a drug addicted mother. Chiron nicknamed 'Little' as a child, is left on his own throughout most of the his youth, falling prey to bullies and hiding in abandoned crack homes, until a local drug dealer, Juan, finds hims and decides to take him under his wing, in a way. Juan soon discovers that Little is experiencing feelings and thoughts which elude to the nature of his sexuality, or what could be; Juan enlist the help of his girlfriend Teresa to help give Little a sense of acceptance in a life. In the process, Juan himself deals with a painful reality as his life intertwines with Little's as Little grows into the next phases of his life as a teenager trying to make it through at least one day in high school without being terrorized and into adult hood, where he becomes everything he least expected but society, in a way, accepts as the norm.

   The film speaks volumes as to the culture of a modern society. From the oppression of being anything other than what is accepted to the shedding of his childhood nickname 'Little,' the emergence of Chiron and his sexuality during his teenage years is explored underneath the moonlight. Fueled by continuing bullying for who he is, confusion over whether it's right or wrong, and the anger felt when he is rejected, Chiron grows into his alter ego, Black, crafted behind bars in a cage he put himself in. That same imprisonment was felt for him mentally and emotionally as he would try to forget what he feels is true. There is one scene in particular where Black stares into the street and hears the soft roar of cars going back and forth, sounding close to the soft roar of the ocean sprawling onto the sand, eclipsing all his thoughts into a memory where he felt the most insecure, the most confused, but also the most free. It is a reminder of the way he felt when Juan told his story to him, when he later discovered his true self under the moonlight, and that faithful moment where he builds the courage to accept what is true.

   Moonlight isn't the traditional story you would come to expect from a film, but it is a powerful one that quietly builds on the words that should have been spoken until they are finally said. The performances are heartfelt, and intense, and real in the way that you not only believe but know that this world and the people that inhabit it are just around the corner. Mahershala Ali gives an outstanding performance as Juan, a strong but morally challenged character, giving Juan a sense of duty and redemption in raising Little. Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes all give life to Chiron through the different stages in his life. Naomie Harris and Janelle Monáe give equally strong performances as Chiron's mother and as his mentor in life. The film is also backed but an equally strong and gifted director in Barry Jenkins, crafting elegant shots and building atmospheric tension. Moonlight may be a small, self contained story but it is a heartfelt story and one that is maybe often heard but never seen, especially through the eyes of those who live that reality.
Terrible movie!! Don't waste your time or money!! Storyline was not good at all, very disappointing to say the least.
Good, honest movie. I wanted more...
Intense, extremely well acted 
95% on the Ricksta Scale
A moving, unconventional film about a black man, Chiron, growing up in Miami. He comes under the influence of a drug dealer who he meets in an abandoned apartment, deals with his mother's addiction issues, gets taunted in school, lashes out, and ultimately connects with another young man, Kevin. The last of three sections brings him back together with Kevin after they've been separated by time and distance for a quiet, terse, nostalgic, and affecting reunion. The film is understated and involving with good acting and a glimpse of a community not frequently depicted on film and almost never in this way.
Speechless. One of the best films of the year.
A finely-honed masterpiece that deserves a wide audience, simply for its matured and sensitive telling of an ostracised gay black man's life. Shattering!
Cultural cages, societal encumbrances, stereotypical demands be damned. What you expect of your movie characters is not what you get here, and what a treat that is. Believe the hype. Everyone should see this film.
A seldom seen topic on film, if ever.  It was sad and touching, with some beautiful moments, really special performances. But I felt like more attention was paid to style and less to script, expecting us to know what characters were thinking at times.  And there were some conversations I didn't fully understand towards the end (the slang).  I must say, Diana Ross does a much better heroin addict in Lady Sings the Blues than Chiron's mother.  I am glad this film was made and is doing well, but I didn't love it.
This was flat out amazing. Rare magic of story telling among the details that are caught and appreciated. It's not your typical how to be black in America and also gay. However it's broken into 3 acts throughout one mans life of growing up with no father, junkie mom and the few yet precious moments in life that are powerful enough to change the course of your life and that can define you as a human being. 

I think all 3 parts are truly mesmerizing and shot with such exquisite detail to facial  changes because Chiron was a child, man who speaks with how  he facially reacts. My favorite part of the film is at the end of act one, Chiron went to Juans house (the drug dealer who takes an interest in him) and there sitting with Jains girls and Chirons looking at the table and asking really mature hard to answer questions and Juan is trying to Answer however,  it was building up to this last scene where now Chiron asks if Juan sells drugs and Juan immediately turns all of his facial reaction and overall way into how Chiron typically responds nom verbally yet you know what he's feeling. 

Great film, highly recommend not sure if it's number 1 on my 2016 list but in the top 3 for sure.
"Who is you" is the repeated refrain of Moonlight, the story of Miami-born Chiron told in three chapters corresponding to three ages (grade school, high school, and mid-20s). The answer is complicated. Chiron is shy. Chiron is black. Chiron is poor. Chiron is the son of an neglectful mother and absent father. Chiron is the target of bullies. Chiron is coming to grips with his homosexuality. Chiron seems to be a laundry list of melodrama and angst, but it's to Moonlight's great credit that it never loses sight of the fact that Chiron is Chiron. Moonlight is, more than anything else, a emotionally resonant and empathetic character study. The fact that is has beautiful cinematography, a tremendous score and soundtrack, and shines a light on a traditionally ignored segment of the population is all gravy.

Each chapter is titled for a moniker of the main character (Little, Chiron, and Black, respectively), and grapples with his self-identity. The three chapters can be roughly broken down into three epiphanies: understanding your world, understanding your self, and understanding how to accept and be honest about your self. Every side character is written solely in terms of their relation to Chiron (I can only think of one scene without the main character), including a drug dealer who becomes his de facto father figure and his friend Kevin, who greatly influences his fortitude and his sexuality. Despite Chiron being a person of few words, director Barry Jenkins' camera and the performances of the three actors playing Chiron give us a complete, intimate picture, transcending the shallow stereotypes that appear on the surface, particularly in its third act. It seems ready to jump into yelling, violence, and melodrama at any point, but opts for restraint in nearly every case while still providing pathos and catharsis.

What pushes Moonlight from effective to extraordinary is its beautiful production. Jenkins' frames are all a piece of art unto themselves, popping with slightly over-saturated colours (the full title of the original play is In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, and you better believe they get that shot). There's a lot to dissect in each image, and they paint a vibrant and distinctive world in spite of the often depressing material. The soundtrack is loaded with the kind of old soul and R&B that Kanye West made a career out of sampling, contrasting with the strings of the stunning original score. And the performances are fantastic from top to bottom, with Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali deserved locks for supporting Oscar nominations.

Moonlight is an utterly absorbing and beautiful film with unflailing empathy for its main character. It avoids the numerous awards-bait pitfalls, standing a singular and triumphant work. As a piece of visual art, Moonlight is worthy of study. As a gripping drama, Moonlight is entirely effective. As a time capsule of an era where identity has taken centre stage, Moonlight is maybe the most important and relevant film of the year.
Moonlight is a timely film telling one boy's journey through life. Each cast member bings something else to the story in their limited time. The way the story is told however limits how impactful each portrayal truly is.
best film of the year
Very emotional film here. The cinematography is gorgeous, the characters are relatable, and the setting is realistic. Very highly recommended.
Just sensational.......... a heartbreaking movie.
Moonlight is a satisfyingly emotional experience that's as well crafted as it is told. 
Grade: B+
Just got out of it......As a gay man, this was a joke of a "good movie".  They gave 9 of the 12 in the theater their money back.  What the hell movie are you all watching?
This movie!  It was beautiful, moving, artistic and the best movie have seen all year. Go see it!!!
I found Moonlight to be powerful and moving. Chiron's tale from boyhood to adulthood and dealing with his sexuality in a rough area of Miami was fantastically portrayed by all three actors (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes). All of the key roles were performed well but Mahershala Ali stood out for his performance of Juan. The direction and cinematography were excellent and I loved the colours used throughout. Absolutely loved Moonlight and it's one of the years best.
Beautifully shot, well acted and quite honest but boring!
A subtle, quietly heartbreaking story told in three vignettes that features some absolutely stunning filmmaking.
Really great movie, writing, acting, directing, cinematography, score all top notch.  Go see it in the theater if you possibly can.
Well made. Depressing story, but intriguing glimpse into the hyper masculine African American culture that resolves to repressed homosexuality, drug abuse, poverty, and violence.
This is everything "Boyhood" wasn't, a beautiful subtle masterpiece with no gimmicks
Very slow paced,  long and boring.  Not my favorite
Intimate, haunting, and above all moving; Moonlight is a grand cinematic achievement.
Great movie. Went in with no idea what to expect, but I didn't expect that. Some great parallels and very well directed/edited.
Fantastic Movie if you are lucky enough to have a theater nearby that is playing it. The theater was packed last night even though this has been out since October. Great acting, great story :-).
Beautiful movie! Wonderful acting with great character development.
Sublime!!! Absolute perfection!!!!
one of my favorite films of all time.
A raw and heartfelt meditation on love, sexuality, masculinity and growing up. Where this film truly succeeds are in all the small ways other movies often miss: the way characters watch each other, change their posture when around each other, the basics of human interaction that we all know and experience every day, laid bare for the camera. This one deserves every ounce of praise it receives.
A raw and powerful film with superb performances.
I thought it had a terrific screenplay and the acting was excellent. The third act of the film was the strongest, but the rest was pretty good too.
This movie is horrible.  No idea what these reviewers are thinking. The pacing is slow and painful.  The film has zero plot.  As a viewer you wait... and wait... and wait... for something to happen.  But nothing ever does and the movie ends.  BADLY.  Abruptly and badly.  Just horrible movie.
Wow. Liked the idea, acting was great. The end was left open, but it was still good.
A great movie by any knowledgeable rubric, I am confident in saying.
Fantastic film with each section building upon the last.
Entertaining and emotional for the first 2 acts but starts to drag in the last. However, Moonlight still features Oscar worthy performances.
The hope to make a connection from the heart to the character's plight in a film, is the sole purpose of attending a film; there was no connection here. While there was certainly beauty in the tactful way that Chiron's life was wrought with tragedy, his presence was lackluster. It's surprising to say that throughout all the challenges of this character, Chiron did not reach out to the viewer as much as he could have. There were a few moving scenes, like that of Little's confrontation/realization of Juan's effect on his life and therefore his mother's quality of life. My heart was yearning to keep the wheels spinning in that direction and to build depth of compassion toward Chiron as he progresses toward adulthood. It is a harsh reality, that sometimes there is no plateau or escape from anesthetizing oneself from being dealt a poor hand of cards, however, the paramount merging of the audience and the protagonist's plight was absent. This movie is not about a racial agenda, it is about feeling lost and never quite feeling found. It could have been so much more, it had potential with the artistry of its cinematography and poetic framework; Moonlight needed to grab those watching by the heartstrings through Chiron's eyes and it missed the mark. Overall, it was not a terrible film, it simply needed to synchronize what was churning in Chiron's mine, aching in his bones through dialogue and more outward expression. 
I enjoyed watching this film, but I was left wanting more, feeling empty without truly fighting for peace and acceptance in Chiron's life.
Most realist acting ever portrayed on screen with a powerful screenplay and masterful direction!
This is not just a film, this is an incredible experience.
One of the year's most well made films with great performances but failed to impact me the way I would have hoped. 8.1/10
this is the Oscar best picture winner, hands down. it's the zeitgeist movie, it feels dangerous (like a documentary) but underneath so tender, it's Boyhood but with a main character with actual problems. it's haunting and beautiful and I want it to win all the awards. All the awards.
They should put a warning on movies that cover topics that might disturb normal people .
Absolutely amazing acting! So is the cinematography, in a gritty, messy sort of way. And the score is spot on. And the story is unbelievably sad and hard to watch, yet, apparently, realistic. This is not anywhere near the stereotypical presentation of Black life in cinema. This is an eye opening experience. I was/am awestruck.
A finely-crafted visual poem about what it means to be human.
A compassionate masterpiece with veins that run red with empathy and humanity. "Moonlight" is a story about adolescence, self-discovery, the pains of growing, and the vital importance of compassionate and strong parental roles.

One thing that I respect most about this film is the fearlessness found in this film's moments of silence. It's efficient, heavy use of silence that is never without purpose or a function within the narrative.
A different story about a kid who happens to be gay and his struggle through life. It's a different movie that some may not like but it's worth a shot and it's good to try something new and original.
In the 2014 film Boyhood, we watched a young boy grow up over a twelve year period. You can say that Moonlight shares a similar trajectory as we watch a young black man grow up over three different periods of his life. The first section showcases Chiron (Hibbert) as a nine-year old kid who's nicknamed "Little" based on his smaller, weaker stature compared to the other kids his age. He barely speaks a word and is mercilessly teased by his classmates. His home life isn't any better as his mother, Paula (Harris), is a drug addict. The only good influence in his life is a man named Juan (Ali) who takes Chiron in one night after finding him hiding in an abandoned apartment. He and his wife, Teresa (Monáe), become the guardian angels he needs at this point. The second section of the film finds Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) in high school where we find it has only gotten worse for him. His mother is still having issues, and Chiron faces a barrage of bullying from his other classmates who believe he may be gay. The final act of the film finds Trevante Rhodes playing a twenty something Chiron now buff and chiseled on the outside but still fighting those inner demons of how he can be a better version of himself despite the horrible influences he has had over the years.

It was probably within the first few minutes of this film when I realized how impactful Moonlight was going to be. It's also made very clear early on that it was not going to be an easy journey to sit through. The second scene of the film has Chiron/Little running away from his bullies. It's there where director Barry Jenkins sets in place the harsh reality of this world. Jenkins also wrote the film's screenplay basing it on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, which was influenced by his childhood. Jenkins expanded on the characters and themes while weaving in his own experiences and memories growing up. While some of the dialogue and action deal in symbolic metaphors, the reality presented feels very grounded and personal for Jenkins and McCraney. The characters are by no means dramatic stereotypes but extremely flawed individuals whom Jenkins and McCraney grew up with whether it was their mothers, friends, or mentor figures. 

Each one of the characters, whether it's Juan, Teresa, Paula, or Chiron's friend Kevin, play a different role in his upbringing and the shaping of who he becomes by the end of the movie. Jenkins has a phenomenal ensemble of actors who all bring such complexity to their characters. I primarily know Mahershala Ali from his work on House of Cards, but his portrayal of Juan is the kind of performance, which could be overlooked at first viewing. Despite being a dealer himself, he is the only strong figure in Chiron's life. Ali carries so much weight in his silent, quieter moments as he comes to grips with the choices he has made in life and what that may mean for Chiron. I was honed in on watching every regret and battle that goes through his eyes. Another staggering performance comes from Naomie Harris who is the only actor to appear in all three acts. Don't worry, that's not really a spoiler about the other adult characters in Chiron's life. She's probably best known for playing the new Moneypenny in the last two James Bond films, Skyfall and Spectre. It's more of an explosive role compared to Mahershala Ali's, as she is high on crack and volatile toward Chiron at any given point. My heart just sank in their scenes together. The movie rests on the shoulders of the three actors playing Chiron: Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes. This is Hibbert's first film, while Sanders and Rhodes have limited credits to their name. Chiron is not a vocal character and keeps everything guarded and internal. None of them met each other while filming or talked about their take on the character with each other. With the guidance of Barry Jenkins, they create a complete picture of who Chiron is as he struggles with every aspect of his life. 

While it focuses on a side of African American culture and Chiron's environment, there are universal themes that can be reflected upon even if don't have a personal connection to the specific world presented in the film. Moonlight deals with the struggles that accompany self-acceptance, masculinity, sexuality, finding your place in this world, dealing with societal pressures, and growing up that anyone can relate to in some form. It's very evident how real this story is as many people share these issues across the country. We know this as stories of bullying, homophobia, and race relations come across the news at an alarming rate. 

Moonlight is the kind of movie that shines a light on our youth and the impact our environment has on our development, not just as kids but how we continue to learn and grow as adults. I would be very surprised if it doesn't move you in some way. Barry Jenkins has crafted a story that hopefully prompts great discussion afterwards whether you fully understand it right away or not. You may not get it all right away and that's okay. That's where continual dialogue comes into play. I can see it being the perfect teaching tool for kids or adults who may be struggling, who may feel in isolation, who can't find their way, and needs reassurance that life will get better.

Whether it's the powerful actors, the cinematography, or the gripping music from Nicholas Britell, you find yourself fully immersed in the three act emotional life of this character. As you may have gathered, it's not an easy movie to watch. The bullying of Chiron in high school can really hit you hard. Every beat and moment is directed with perfection to constantly keep you on your toes as to which direction it may go and what choice any given character is going to make. You can really feel the back and forth pull Chiron faces whether he gives into temptation or goes against his truth. There aren't many movies in any given year that sit with me or shake me up in the days that followed. Moonlight did that very thing. I want to go back and take it in all over again. 

Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? See it. Reflect on it. Talk about.

RATING: 5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS
The most progressive movie of the year.  This is the story of a black male at different stages of his life.  Sometimes he is known as Little, sometimes he is known as Chiron, and sometimes he is simply known as Black.  Just like all of us, he is just trying to find his place in the world, but he's got the deck stacked against him, given he is coming from poverty, is assimilated into drug culture, and is not heterosexual.  Even if the Oscars didn't just make its way through #OscarsSoWhite, I promise you that this would be getting some serious recognition, it is just that kind of movie.  Moonlight is about to get nominations all over the place, and they will all be completely well deserved; it really is such a compelling story that they have brought to the screen, and it is not one that we typically ever get to see.  What makes this movie so great is that this is a story that doesn't ever really get told, both cinematically and in media in general.  Seriously, what is the last movie that you can recall that focuses on a person who is both African-American and gay?  You'll see either or, but I am drawing a gigantic blank on the last time it was both.  That fact alone makes it a movie that you want to see people go out and support, but being that is an engrossing story on top of it makes you want to sell it as a movie that even more people should see.  In addition to that, there is an in-depth look at drug culture as well.  This is almost always sensationalized in movies; I love Training Day, but not every drug dealer is an evil monster, and it is actually refreshing to see more grounded characters.  Mahershala Ali is only in this movie for a brief amount of time, but he makes a large impression, being a father figure for Chiron despite being a dealer.  The three actors they got to play the same character all do very well.  They all look similar, especially from going from Little to Chiron in the transition from segment one to segment two.  You can totally see that this is the same person, which is a feat that is difficult to pull off in cinema.  This is a terrific movie because you grow with the character.  Chiron is a man of few words, which does make it easy to see the world through his eyes, regardless of what your personal race or sexual preference may be.  Moonlight brings the drama, and while it may be on the slower side considering modern movie tendency towards action, it is still very well paced for the story being told.  It's a reflective piece, and I really want to see this movie succeed.
The story Boyhood wanted to tell.
Good, but a little over-hyped.
it was a super depressing partial story. I love all movies, all movies, this might have been my least favorite movie of all time. The only redeeming character in the whole movie is a drug dealer, who isn't believable add a drug dealer, and hes gone immediately from thed story without much explanation. The main character suffers at the hands of everyone he meets, why does that this movie worthy of praise? Save your money & turn on the news, you get that for free. Im so genuinely confused about why people think this movie is so good.
Fabulous film that made me very uncomfortable. I really didn't want to see what it's like to grow up poor, black, gay in Miami but that shouldn't stop it from being the movie of the year.
Amazing movie of quiet moments that scream truth. Great acting and a visionary director.
Really really well done. Well deserving of best picture
Everything about Moonlight is beautifully executed, from it's stunning visuals to it's incredibly effective score. Easily one of the most powerful films of 2016. Mahershala Ali gives an unforgettable performance as Juan.
On January 14th 2016, the nominations for the 88th Academy Awards were announced. With this list a very controversial list which not including african americans in the main categories sparks a series of complaints to the academy for not including big actors like Will Smith, Michael B Jordan or director Ryan Cooler or even consider them for the awards. 

The origin of Oscar So White generates a dramatic change in the foundations of the Academy promising more diversity for the years to come. The film industry have always put minorities in the second place, sometimes cataloging their movies in sub genres. Powerful film from directors like Ava Duvernay, Spike Lee, John Singleton, Lee Daniels, Don Cheadle. Tyler Perry and Antonie Fuqua have created masterful movies about the struggle of african americans in this country. Boyz in the Hood, Malcom X, The Buttler, Selma, Do the Right Thing. Have given lessons to the audience about their culture and way of life. 

The last film to portray masterfully the hard life in the black community is "Moonlight", well crafted by director Barry Jenkins which tells the story of Chiron a african american kid who lives with his mother Paula (Naomi Harris) an abusive and controlling drug addict. The film is divided in three chapters i.Little: about Chiron (Alex Hibbert) childhood, when he meet Juan (Mahersala Ali) a crack dealer who discover him hiding from bullies from school, his only comfort is his friendship with Kevin. Chiron 

ii.Chiron This time Chiron (Ashton Sanders) is a teenager, who is harassed threaten ad bullied in school and outside school by his peers. His mother Paula is now addicted to crack, solicit herself and coerce Chiron to get her money. His friend Kevin, becomes closer to him (Chiron) which end up kissing him and giving some sexual interaction. On this chapter the audience discover all the rage that Chiron is been holding for so long. During an episode in the school, Kevin is forced to fight Chiron by Terrel a troublemaker from the school, this concludes in a brutal beaten of Chiron, later taking revenge on Terrel.

iii. Black: Chiron is am adult a drug dealer living in Atlanta, following the footsteps of his father figure Juan, even driving his car. Paula's calls him constantly to be visited by him. Kevin reappears looking for Chrion to pay him a visit at a restaurant where he cooks in Miami. 

Moonlight explore a world a person that could be anyone of us, the same problems, the same aspirations, the same dreams. In this case the film is not trying to reminds you that Chiron lives in a certain neighborhood, is just a though life to live. Is hard to say if this movie is the direct consequence in the search of a film for the "So white" Oscar voters. But what I'm certain this movie is powerful drama, made with such a poetic images, fill with metaphors about the life and how cyclic is our existence, following the same paths. 

In times where been a minority in this country is consider a threat,  this film is the response of how societies can survive by been tolerant, overcome our difficulties but mostly stay close to your roots.
Moonlight is an excellent film full of powerful performances and a fascinating main character.

Very powerful and emotional flick. The film focuses on a young mans internal struggles for his attraction towards other men while dealing with living with a neglecting drug addicted mother . I highly recommend this film but also, be prepared to shed a few tears.
The biggest strength of Moonlight is the performances. Three actors play Chiron at three different stages of his life, with Alex R. Hibbert playing him as a kid, Ashton Sanders playing him as a teenager, and Trevante Rhodes playing him as an adult. I thought all three did fantastic jobs playing the same character, especially when director Barry Jenkins wouldn't let the three actors ever meet the other, as to prompt them to take the character in their own, unique direction. It really works on screen, as the writing for the character is the same, but each actor brings a new shade and a new element to the character as he grows older and progresses. Although, I think Mahershala Ali was my favorite part of the movie. I loved him on Luke Cage, and I've been wanting to see more from him, and here he brought it. He plays an important role in Chiron's life...

Rompe esquemas, la Brokeback Mountain de los afroamericanos. Una pelÃ­cula dura, realista, conmovedora. Con mucha clase. Actuaciones de primera
His one is interesting. I'm not sure I loved it but definitely recognize it as a great film. Greatly cast. Great script.
Best movie I have seen in a long time !
really slow, really dull. one of those movies that when i read the extravagant reviews i really wonder what they were watching.....
It was ok, story just wasn't that grabbing. Thought ending was weak. I don't know why the reviews were so high. Maybe I fell asleep during the good parts.
It was disappointed !
Absolutely phenomenal movie. The directing, editing, and sound were spot on. The performances throughout the movie were excellent, although I suspect the directing and editing carried that. I can't wait to see what movies come next from this director. Easily in my top 3 this year.
Interesting slice of life told in three acts. Well paced and well-acted, but ultimately there are no epiphanies or feel-good moments, so it's a bit grim. One of those films that felt more important (because it portrays a rarely-examined character) than satisfying.
Exceptionally lyrical in cinematography, sound design, acting  and direction. A bit slow at times but touching even if the mother on crack and gay son in the druggy inner city I find a bit of a common place even if honest and relevant. It's still a movie, not a documentary, but see it win a bunch of Oscars.
This is how movies are should be made. It felt like i was in the movie and lived it. The cinematography is amazing and sound. This movie brought me to tears. I Believe everyone should see this if you are a fan of movies.
Flawless.  Here is a film that understands perfectly how to show rather than tell.  The phrase "hauntingly beautiful" gets thrown around generously in film reviews; Moonlight is one of the few to deserve such praise.
This is probably one of the most interesting movies I have seen this year. It is three periods in the life of a gay black man, from childhood to adult. A dope fiend mother, constant bullying in school, a hint of love, and betrayal lead to a sort of resolution, albeit not a happy one, as an adult. This movie is almost perfect as a picture of a life. You might not catch it as it is an Indie in limited release, but if you have the chance go for sure. Not my usual pick with action but still a movie I am thinking about days later, worth the effort.
Very well made, but not quite as substantial as everyone is making it out to be.
I see a lot of movies, and  only once in a great while  do I see a greatly reviewed film which I find to be a complete waste of time. These include Lost in Translation and American Beauty. If you agree with me about those, skip that film. If you thought they were great films, you might like this one. To me Moonlight was slow and boring. I've got to wonder whether at least some of the reviews are the result of white guilt over the terrible situations facing many black people. But, I will admit, maybe I just don't get it.
Movie Roslyn: Excellent - touching
Good story, great acting.  A bit too slow.  The jumpy handheld camera work was distracting, a real drawback for me.
Moonlight is one of the best films I've seen. It centers Black, queer identities without trapping the characters in a narrative of trauma. This is a piece of truth that centers Black queer identities, and it's done beautifully. The actors are all brilliant, the script is groundbreaking, and all in all, this is a groundbreaking film and a remarkable piece of cinema.
I really did not like this movie at all. It had interesting moments, but overall it seemed to plod slowly along without a central point of tension or excitement, so it failed to show enough emotion or drama leaving an overall lackluster feeling. Also, the three actors that represented "Black" from youth to adult had a startling lack of physical resemblance to each other. In addition, the drug dealer, a central character in the youngster's life dies without an explanation. The movie suddenly ends giving the feeling being left hanging.
Unlike anything you've seen before but better.
Breathtaking, heartbreaking, powerful. Rare do we see the lives depicted in this film, the vulnerability behind finding your sexuality in a culture that is so defined on masculinity. I was left wanting more and more and more. My only criticism: more Mahershala Ali please. Thank you.
Amazingly intriguing and real
Beautifully acted. Occasionally slow paced, but ultimately -  powerful story telling.
The story of becoming a man, race, sexuality and shyness portrayed beautifully on film. An American poem. Drama of the year.
Masterpiece. Excellent acting and cinematography. Compelling!
Still tearing up over this hours later. Powerful stuff.
great subject matter awful storytelling and acting
This movie tells the story of my life, simply put, except the broken family issues. So yeah, its a much worse life but I could still relate to it in a huge way. Must see!
Boring. Slow as molasses. Go if you need to sleep
This movie had zero plot. Zero. Usually when someone "explores" their sexuality, you're exploring between 2 or more different decisions. This kid was gay and he knew it the whole entire time. The acting was poor. The best actor was Juan the drug dealer and that's not saying much, and then they killed him off and his girlfriend disappears out of nowhere.

They pick 3 characters who didn't look anything alike so they felt like 3 different people. The ending was an embarrassment to cinema and there were scenes that were overly sexual and if those parts got toned down, the movie wouldn't have lost anything.

The movie felt long because it was boring. Had no excitement, when I'd love to ask the people where were the "heartbreaking" moments? I felt zero emotional connection.

This movie is highly acclaimed for cultural reasons. Critics would feel bad if they had to say this movie wasn't that good. Same thing with the hurt locker. I ask people please don't just like this movie because it's about a gay black man. Look at the movie as a whole and see the obvious flaws in the plot.
"Moonlight" is the perfect embodiment of what a "Coming of Age" film should be, but it does it in such a way that it doesn't just attempt to be a genre film, and it doesn't try to push any agenda despite the main character being a black gay man in America. It's just a perfectly told story about a person's life... who also just so happens to be both black and gay. It's used as a detail instead of a plot devise, and because of that it elevates the movie. The cinematography, script, and especially directing is beyond what we see time and time again in film today. The performances never feel forced, the movie is visually beautiful, and this is one of those films that will stand the test of time because of it's subtlety.
A beautiful masterpiece.
This is a wonderful film. The characters have depth, the cinematography was superb and the script excellent. This could be an academy award contender.
This movie blew me away. All I can say is SEE IT. This is best picture Oscar material but, because it involves a main character who discovers he's gay, it may not. Impressive all around and I loved the music choices. Perfect!
This is one of the most touching and moving movies of the year and should be on the list for movie of the year. This movie showed 3 different chapters of an African American man that had a hard time fitting in society and he tried to do his best to make friends and try to get self confidence to stand up to his bullies. His druggy embarrassing mother really had an affect on him emotionally and you can see that throughout the movie. This movie is very gripping and will make some people cry and that makes a great film.
I think sometimes reviews on Flixster not real.  There were a few good parts in the movie but generally speaking it was very slow and boring.
Rare slice of life film
Moonlight is a beautiful character study with some great emotions and outstanding acting.
Chiron, aka "Little", is a slightly-built 9-year-old who lives in a rough neighborhood in Miami. The other boys regularly beat him up because, according to his oft-abusive, crack-smoking mother, he walks in an effeminate manner. "Little" has one friend named Kevin who encourages him to stand up for himself, though I don't think it ever happens. He's befriended by a drug dealer named Juan and Juan's girlfriend Teresa who feed him fried chicken and teach him to swim and try to answer his questions about sexual identity. 

We next see Chiron when he's a skinny 16-year-old who no longer goes by the name "Little". He's still struggling with the idea of being gay and still gets beaten up regularly. His mother is now a full-blown crackhead and Teresa's house still provides a refuge. Kevin is still his only friend but only when no one else is watching. 

In the film's final act, Chiron, who's now about 26, goes by the name "Black", a nickname Kevin gave him when the two were teenagers. "Black" is a big, buff guy who sports a diamond earring and gold grillz and looks nothing like his 16-year-old self. When Kevin calls him out of the blue after no contact in almost ten years, "Black" drives to Miami from his home in Atlanta for a visit. 

it would be easy to categorize "Moonlight" as a gay, black movie, when in fact, it's a very GOOD gay, black movie. But even more so, it's a movie about identity - who we are and how we came to be that person.

It's kind of like "Boyhood" except that Chiron has a way harder life and doesn't become an insufferable twit when he grows up and he's played by three different actors instead of the gimmick of filming one kid over twelve years. So maybe it's really not that much like "Boyhood" except for the fact that they're both coming-of-age stories that show how stuff that happens to us as kids makes us into who we are as adults. 

"Moonlight" is sad and intense and sometimes hard to watch and occasionally even funny. It's probably the best movie I've seen all year, which would have meant more back when I was seeing a movie every week, but still.
A theatrical experience
Barry Jenkins' film about a gay black mans depressing & vivid journey through life, can be a tough watch at times but at least there's always a glimmer of light even in the darkness.
Very moving. Very well filmed. A must see.
Perfect example of how powerful a "movie without a plot" can be.
Moonlight is the best movie I've seen this year so far since this is one of the most powerful and extraordinary films I've ever seen, and the pure definition of this being a cinematic masterpiece!
The best performances. Emotional. Telling.
Moonlight tackles relevant and important issues that plague the culture with powerful imagery dealing with sensitive subject material. Unfortunately the lack of narrative cohesion and character depth result in an unbalanced film that needed more substance.
While no doubt a revolutionary film in terms of subject matter, and I applaud the film for being a first to substantively tackle minorities within the LGBT community, Moonlight, though well acted particularly thanks to Marshala Ali, is a poorly plotted, character driven film that doesn't offer complexity in a character study beyond sadness to satisfy a viewers nourishment. A film that will be lauded by most based purely on subject matter, but not scrutinized for its ability to be a better film.
Certainly deserves the praise that Moonlight is receiving even if not quite up to the insanely high standards that the critics are throwing on the film.  Still one of my favorites of 2016, will cement a place in the bottom half of my Top 10 list I believe.
just cause that's the lowest option available movie SUCKED Literally!!!ð~?
I was so excited to see this only to be extremely underwhelmed. Easily the most overhyped movie of 2016. The story is unbelievably predictable and is as surface as they come. The cliches surrounding this story are mashups from others and doesn't say anything new or important with the message. There are 3 great shots that stuck with me and it's well shot on a technical aspect but it's incredibly vapid. It's great to see more diversity in movies, but I want some substance to go along with it.
good movie; good story that drags a little.  excellent performances by the whole cast.
an incredibly story with incredible performances. one of the year's best films.
One of the best films of the year and the best "gay" movie since Brokeback Mountain. Heart wrenching and beautifully acted. A must see
Really well written, acted and made indie film. In the top movies of the year so far for sure.
The performances excellent from the three actors portraying Chirone, while also the supporting cast were great as well. Also the cinematography looked very good and the story although not necessarily what is usually made is very progressive and necessary. It truly was a very intimate and touching story of people that don't get represented. 
~November 22, 2016~
Great film for humans. Nuff Said!
The critics are right on this one; you should watch it.
So glad this movie was brought back to theaters. I loved it. Mainly because Trevante Rhodes was in it. But I also loved the message. Be who you are. Don't allow anyone to bully you.
A wonderful little movie, though not without its flaws.

The film tells the story of a gay black man during three stages of his life: Childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.

Let's start with the good. The acting is phenomenal across the board. The two best performances belong to Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. Ali is only in the first third of the film, but he brings a fatherly affection hat just jumps off the screen. He's warm, caring, looks out for our main character, Chiron, and seems like he'd be a good dad despite being a drug dealer. Harris is also great as Chiron's drug addicted mother. She appears in all three parts of the film and seizes every moment she is given, ranging from drug withdrawal to saying she loves her son even though he may not love her. A shoutout should also be given to Andre Holland, who plays the adult version of Chiron's best friend in the third half. His performance is right up there with Ali and Harris in this one.

The narrative device the film uses for the most part works, but the first two parts are much stronger than the final third. This is actually the film's only weakness. The issue is Chiron seems to get less interesting by the time part three rolls around. This isn't really the fault of any of the actors playing Chiron. They all do very well with what they're given to work with, but I suppose Andre Holland sums it up best when he says that the Chiron we get is not the one we expected.


Still, the good far outweighs the bad. Ali and Harris should get Supporting Oscar consideration for this and the emotional punches hit their mark. The acting is the film's greatest strength and that alone makes it worth the watch.
Beautifully shot, and well directed. A bit of a slow burn, with an atypical story arc and climax. It did a good job of demonstrating painful realities of the life of this young man without showing too much, or doing so in a sadistic or vouyeristic way. For those who like a lot of action, this movie isn't for you. But if you like seeing the various moments that shape a man into who he is and see how he discovers his identity, moonlight is a wonderful film, representing a rarely seen protagonist.
Barry Jenkins most certainly makes a name for himself. The drama takes its time while maintaining a watchable pace. Feels like a film the indie boom of the '90s forgot to include.
"Moonlight" is a stunning, beautifully shot, beautifully scored, greatly acted film about a young black kid (man) coming to grips with his homosexuality, dealing with school bullies and an abusive, drug fueled mother played brilliantly by Naomi Harris, in fact everyone in Barry Jenkin's newest film are quite astounding in their roles, you could tell that everyone involved in the film cared about what they were doing, and in doing so they've delivered one of the best films of this year, and one of the best films in recent years. "Moonlight" is truly a remarkable piece of cinema and a must see for cinephiles everywhere.
It's subtle performances and methodical placing of just the right dialogue at just the right time combine for a captivating and thoroughly enjoyable experience
I waited a couple days after having seen this in order to give it a proper rating and it most definitely deserves a perfect score. Like Chiron (the main character) himself, this quietly devastating film finds hope in unexpected places. Above all, it truly challenges preconceived notions about masculinity and reminds viewers to look for the beauty in even the bleakest situations. Outstanding film from the acting, the directing, the original score by Nicholas Britell, to everything in between. "Moonlight" shines (no pun intended) by focusing on a more "show, don't tell" approach to filmmaking. You'll understand a lot from its characters and situations in the quiet moments, the music, the expressions... Moving film, really good stuff!
Hmmmmm.... was beautifully shot, but oddly slow..
This is a difficult film to watch but so worth it.  It feels so personal and is at the same time an urgent social document with a hard look at American reality.
Absolutely the worst movie of the year and my #2 worst of all time. I thought Tyler Perry's halloween movie was the worst, but this overdid it. I was ready to walk out in the first 15 minutes. I tried to walk out during the last 30 min but my female guest told me to deal with it to the since I picked it. Horrible plot, beginning, ending, etc. Flickster - you owe me my money back since I used your rating to choose this movie. I am not telling anyone I saw this movie.
Phenomenal! Best acting from an ensemble this year.
This was a really wonderful and sensitive film.
The actors were terrific.
Wow! A strong story, well directed and the performances are Oscar worthy. I enjoyed the journey.
After the movie I was asked if I liked the movie.  No.  I didn't.  I didn't like it. I know I'm supposed to, but the storyline isn't strong. My favorite parts of the movie occurred in the first half, and I couldn't wait to use the bathroom even though I didn't really need to.
The acting was performed extremely well so that the film appeared believable as if I was watching a documentary. However, the dialect was difficult to understand and the transition to different time periods with different actors was not always clearly done.
Intense. Well done. Smart.
A heart-wrenching film that explores the experience of a homosexual man growing up in Miami.  The exploration of masculinity in the inner-city community and how that effects conversations around sexuality, safety, and emotions is fascinating, while the story at the heart of the film is both tense and tender, all at once.
Amazingly powerful deeply moving movie.  Not a lighthearted movie, but really good.  Nice music choices.  I didn't mind the 3 different actors for both our main characters.  I hope that homophobia and anti-gay sentiment is not as high as this movie makes it feel in the first two acts.  I also liked the food and eating together to unveil story progression.  Some social commentary that I appreciated.  Loved the way the movie ended.
Had so much potential but too sparse for me. Also couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue.
A coming of age film told through three stages of a boy's life; from childhood to adulthood. Each section is played by a different actor, but what is more impressive is how all three actors maintained the same mannerisms. The main character Chiron tries to find himself in Miami. He grows up in a dysfunctional home, he is a big target for bullies and he lives in an area populated by drugs. He also tries to find himself sexually. It is a story about a young man's struggles to become something. A truly absorbing film that is the alternate, more intense version of Boyhood. 

Grade: A
Inspiring, moving and beautifully made. Makes you glad that cinema still exists.
A gorgeous movie that involves you with its characters and makes you feel like you acquired insight as well.
I feel as if screenwriter / director Barry Jenkins grabbed me by the back of the neck and forced my face toward viewing something that I'd rather look away from. Did the bullied become the bully? I have a rough time watching a child in a rough inescapable situation such as a here in Moonlight, where our protagonist, Chiron, is bullied.  And that feeling is intensified because his home is not a safe space either. Every time Chiron finds a refuge, it is yanked away from him. 

The film is remarkable for its collection of excellent performances. Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage) is so good as a drug dealer, Juan, who is not a 2D stereotype but is a really fleshed out person.  I loved that performance. Naomie Harris as the mom swings from protective to manipulative to redeeming.  Janelle Monae  as a surrogate mother figure is a solid support character.  The movie's first act focuses us in on the interaction of Juan and Chiron played by Alex R. Hibbet. This child actor has solid stares and eye avoidances which lock our eyes on the screen. The second act (high school) buddy Kevin played by Jharrel Jerome appears almost as if out of thin air. The character is so natural and garrulous that we automatically know him, but know nothing about who he is inside. It might be because in his talkativeness he is hiding nothing. It is a remarkable performance for a young actor.  The third act belongs to Trevante Rhodes as a grown buffed up drug dealing Chiron with his own muscle car complete with crown air freshener. He has become Juan.  Alex Holland plays a grown up Kevin.  The characters reconnect after a decade apart. The movie steers us to land somewhere other than the hurt cliché that I felt was certain to come. 

Jenkins' movie takes it time. It has a lot of silences. There were moments I felt I might fall asleep, but then young Hibbet would do something to grab my attention. Act 1 has a swimming lesson who imagery is clearly one of a baptism, but even after a night to sleep on it, I don't know what Jenkins meant by it. There are scenes that I don't understand how they avoided a cutting room floor (boy fills bathtub with hot water boiled on a stove top). It doesn't really glamorize its milieu.  There are color and scene motifs which bind our 3 time periods and the different actors playing them. I particularly like the head dunked in water as a motif for Chiron. Maybe it is a continuation of the baptism as a theme.

I don't see this as a particularly beautiful movie technically. The emotional punch did not land for me that way it seems to have for most other people reviewing movies. I was probably turning away from the blow. But I have no qualms about praising the performances, which Barry Jenkins evoked to get what he wanted. So I see a SAG award or two in this movies future. I personally am not a sure about the Oscar buzz. 

Sometimes, an ugly situation is a lesson and sometimes it is just a bit ugly.
Movie is alright . Definitely could live with out seeing it
I enjoy a thoughtful engaging film allowing introspection, but this movie dragged.  I checked the watch a lot...bad sign.
A journey through the heartbreaking life of a young man struggling with his identity. Wonderfully written! Acting was just as good. Definitely worth seeing!
This was so amazing.
Beautiful movie. it's not a fancy movie but very real and true.  the back drop of Miami Beach was very fitting to the story. The cast, ceinamotograpy and story telling were refreshing, complex and honest.
Solid flick. Direction, acting, story. Wouldn't be surprised to see it in the Oscar nods.
Long lingering shots at the expense of character development. The drug dealer,  crackhead mum and school thug are thrown in with no explanation of why or how they've become who they are.  is it obvious to others? Are their journeys less interesting than Black's? i thought the movie could have been so much more.
Intensely sad and sensual.
First Hit:  A powerful, deep, and intense look into a story rarely shared on the big screen.

Shown in three different stages of his life, the audience is given a profoundly penetrating view of a gay black man's life journey. Chiron, also known as "Little" and "Black", is growing up in Miami to a drug addicted mother and no father. He's played in these three stages by Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes respectively.

As "Little" (Hibbert), Chiron is often the odd boy out. He's quiet, sullen, and feels out of place. He's afraid to go home as his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is often high or pushing him out the door to make room for one of her many boyfriends.

He's only got one friend of sorts, Kevin (Jaden Piner), but Kevin cannot stop the other boys from picking on him. While hiding out from bullies who were chasing him, he's discovered in the projects by Juan (Mahershala Ali) who takes a liking to the boy and takes him in. Juan's girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae) feeds the skinny scared boy. They coax him to speak but only get short bursts of two or three words at a time. Juan takes him to the beach and teaches him how to swim. The effect of Juan and Teresa's kindness and understanding permeates the first part of the film even when they are not on the screen and shows up again towards the end of the film.

As "Chiron" (Sanders), the tones of harshness and the extreme difficulty of discovering his life, and who he is, becomes more pronounced. His mom is deeper in her addiction; his prevalent sadness is darker as he knows he's different but has little in the way of social communication tools to help him understand himself. His only friend is still Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). The rage inside is slowly building and comes to a head.

As Black (Rhodes), a nickname given to him by Kevin, he is now an adult. You can see the effect Juan had on him by his car, attitude, and choice of supporting himself. He's away from Miami, his mom is in a rehab, and he still living a life of being alone. He gets a call from Kevin (Andre Holland) who has been thinking of him and invites him down to Miami. Black goes and takes another step in owning his life.

Beautifully shot, the long slow scenes are left to unfold. It isn't easy to let the camera roll staying close to an actor's face without having the actor speak. And at times I wondered if this was smart, but then the next scene would shine light on the reasons why. Each of the actors portraying Chiron allowed the silent inward struggle come to forth; to be shown and not told. To do this, these actors had to pay attention to the director and more importantly, to the story. Each of them kept the sense of longing, unknowing, and sadness throughout the film by sharing specifically for the age being portrayed. This film is fearless in its presentation and the screenwriter and director are to be complemented for this.

Hibbert, Sanders, and Rhodes are each amazingly effective in their singular role. Hibbert's sorrow and anguish as a small boy wondering why he's different was amazing. Sanders's teen existence is superb. He's tall yet trying to hide from everyone including himself and yet he'd like to be seen. Sander's is sublime. Rhodes is perfect as his self-assured exterior belies his inner soft aching. The scenes with his mother and Kevin are extraordinary. Piner, Jerome, and especially Holland are engaging and wonderful as Kevin. Ali is amazing as Juan the sensitive drug dealer who becomes a mentor of sorts for Chiron. Monae is a beautiful light in this heavy picture. Every scene she's in she brings joy and light. Harris is effectively real as Chiron's drug addled mother who really does love her son but has no way to relate to him. Barry Jenkins had a clear vision for what he wanted and wrote an amazingly strong and daring screenplay and brought it to life with stunning direction by getting outstanding performances from everyone.

Overall:  A strong emotionally effective film.
A good movie but it did not come together at the end for me.
Wow this movie shocked me on so many levels. I saw Moonlight thinking I might find something I've seen before or at least something big I've seen before but this is a neat and original look on what poverty, drugs, and social status of inner city can do to someone. It focused on the tear apart of the home, the family with it only be a kid and his mother and his father gone. The performances are great by all three actors who play Chiron at his loss of innocence age Alex Hibbert, at his realization stage Ashton Sanders and his adult stage Trevante Rhodes. Juan was a fascinating character too played by Mahershala Ali with him knowing in a way what he's doing is wrong but takes care of Chiron guiding him. His mother was amazing too played by Naomie Harris starting off a strong mother whos taking care of son split by a job but when the crack epidemic is when things fail. I also loved Juan's girlfriend Teresa played by Janelle Monáe with solid enthusiasm. Director Barry Jenkins proves himself with this film the directing was beautiful. This movie was surely a masterpiece and lived up to the hype. A subtle and delicate approach to this topic. The way this movie was crafted, pacing was amazing too. I love the shot when think shit is about to hit the fan when Chiron pulls a gun but it doesn't show anything there isn't violence in the for of killing over some territory or a gang fight, but the fights are personal and deeply rooted thats where most of the violence stems from. The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in years the shots are done masterfully and this is owed to James Laxton, I would love to see more of his work in the future. I think this is a movie everyone should see whether you can relate or whether you can't, I can these problems are everywhere today people afraid as they'll be slandered for being themselves see Moonlight and you'll a whole new perspective.
Amazing movie that covers so many subjects. Every actor that played the lead role was very good. The movie as a whole presented as very vulnerable
GREAT MOVIE!! DEEP!!
This movie takes you behind the ramparts of male identity and draws you in close enough to see the beads of sweat and blood and desire.  It is incredible film with an outstanding performance from Mahershala Ali.  There are more than a few moments of cinematic brilliance as we spin and focus and refocus on a landscape that is never further than 100 yards from us.  This movie hugs you in close and it's a space you never want to leave.
Nope :(  I didn't get it
With strong performances from all three actors portraying  Chiron, Moonlight shines as one of the best films in 2016.
A story of life, society and love. Be well rested to watch this film as it gives you plenty of pauses to fill the blanks and reflect. It's not contrived.
A painful story of life, survival, and the hard journey
Believe the hype.  This film is incredible.  It's a very honest look at growing up different and following in the footsteps of what you know because being yourself isn't allowed.  

Loved it. Cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is next level.  Cannot imagine how Naomie Harris doesn't get a nod for best supporting for her role.
powerful, melancholy, almost mysterious in hinting at the inner life of the characters.
This is hands down the best film of 2016. Nothing else even comes close. It is that great. Have you ever seen a film so awesome it gets to the point that the screenplay doesn't even matter? What I mean is, late in the film there is a scene in which two men are talking and I can't make out what they are saying, because of ghetto slang, and then I realized it doesn't matter because this film is a bona-fide masterpiece. Telling you the plot does a disservice because A) you won't see it and  B) it won't begin to convey the greatness of this film. It will get underneath your skin. It will devastate you. It reminds me of the film "Precious" which is about another down-and-out ghetto person with ZERO chance of any semblance of happiness through no fault of the person himself or herself. But I feel this film is even greater than "Precious", maybe I feel that way because it gives me the male sensibility. But just like that film one feels as if one is the same as the protagonist.
This was a great movie.
the life of shiron isnt ordinary.His life struggles challenge a lot of unforseen uncertainties.
Superb acting; very intense, moving, passionate.  Well worth seeing.
Never quite sure where they were going with this film.  Quite disturbing. Not what I expected and don't know how it won Best Picture
An great film that is among the best of the year.  Very honest and emotional with excellent performances and direction!
Remarkable, multifaceted film which is not afraid to take on several powerful themes at once.
Some movies have the problem of spoon feeding you what is going on. Moonlight, needed some of those problems. I like what they tried to do, but feel they fell short. I'm not sure if it was the budget, the actors, or the story. I didn't feel like the movie gave a ending, it just runs.
The childhood, teen years and young adult life of a gay African American man is told in three segments in this quietly stunning film.  Chiron, also known as "Little" and "Black" at various times, is played by three different actors in the three time periods.  He struggles with awareness of his sexuality, the abuse he receives at school, his mother's drug addiction and erratic behavior, and a general problem with knowing who he can trust and/or look up to (his one father figure is also his mom's drug dealer; he suffers a significant betrayal from his closest friend).  This makes the film sound melodramatic, but it's very quiet and subtle and often feels half dreamed by the main character.  I enjoyed it, but was a tad underwhelmed until the utterly amazing third segment and a stunning final shot.
will watch again for the jerk off scene.
a thoughtful black gay romance. winner indeed.
A masterpiece served three ways.
Intense. And wonderfully acted and directed
"Moonlight" is a challenging masterpiece, forcing you to question how you look at the art of filmmaking, and think about a slice of life you may turned away from before. I'm exhausted. But I'll never forget it.
An incredible, coming of age film that's sure to touch and inspire.
BRAVO to all who dared to bring this very sensitive but impt. story to the screen - the BEST & most moving film I've seen this year, & I'll see it again!!!!! ????????????
Moonlight is a beautifully directed, elegantly simple story that brings a rarely seen perspective to the screen.
This movie was amazing and emotionally striking. I think Alex Hibbert & Ashton Sanders did an incredible job of bringing Little / Chiron to life as a young man struggling with life and his sexuality while growing up in a tough neighborhood. And I have to say that, even though he was only in the first chapter of the movie, Mahershala Ali  gave a striking performance as well
LIFF30 2016 #4

People told me this was amazing. Actually a lot of people. But wow, nobody warned me this was going to be emotionally striking. Praising this movie for being powerful is just an understatement.

Moonlight is one of best character study movies I've seen this year. The directing, the writing, score, and especially the acting is what this movie so freaking brilliant.

Director Barry Jenkins shot this movie in a very different and unique way. And I say "unique" as how this movie was filmed in a shallow depth that made the whole thing pretty intriguing. I wouldn't say he's directing is complete perfectionist, as there's plenty of room for improvement. Even if you don't like the choices he picked for a scene, but keep in mind that this doesn't equal bad directing. Lets not go that far. You can see that there's talent and he got a lot out of fantastic performances from all the actors.

Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes all did a phenomenal job playing Chiron (the main character). Each of the actors builds on their character that the previous actor did. Despite the changes and the transformation, not once did you see a different person. There was never a moment where I didn't believe in a actor was giving a 100% their all or wasn't invested in the role. In my "A Monster Calls" review I said how great child actors are very rare in big budget movies, but not in indie. Several kid and teenage actors were all pretty fantastic in this, which is quite the accomplishment.

Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali were both outstanding in this movie. It's one of performances I've seen from them. Even through their screen time is shot as Hopkins was in "Silence of the Limbs". And that's kinda impressive. Both manages to give anything in a small matter of time. It's really mind blowing and a real challenge.

But what really surprised me the most was Nicolas Battelle beautiful violin score. Why this took me by surprise is because who's expecting a score like that from a movie that takes place in a gangster ghetto setting. This movie is more of a personal film of are main characters experience than anything else. So music like this fits perfectly and I'm glad it didn't go for a terrible R&B song for once.

The writing is just top-notch and if you're an inspired writer, you should take notes from this. This is how you write great characters. Nothing cartoonist or anything that's one-dimensional. All the character's feel fleshed out and so natural to the point I forgot it was acting. And the best thing I can say about the film is that isn't predicable. I honestly didn't know where the story was going.

When I called this a "character study film", that's because of the arks the main character goes through that leads to the next scene. It starts off with Chiron as a shy child living in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami with his crack addict mother. This leads to him meeting Juan (Mahershala Ali), which leads to him taking a lot from him (appearance wise) when an adult. Him being bulled at school leads to him being buffed, strong, and confident so none can pick on him ever again. But at the same time, he's hiding himself even more by being something that he's not. He acts gangster and talks in a American slang that I bet he doesn't fully understand. You can say different arguments to this, but how I see it, he's just getting better at hiding of who he really is. It's are journey through life that defines us as human beings. Same goes to the rest of the characters. I don't know about you, but that's pretty upsetting.

You know, for awhile I was pretty close of giving "Moonlight" the perfect rating that I never thought would happen. But what stopped me is the little flaws. Some of the editing choices didn't really hit at times and lucky it didn't happen too often. I also notice some sound errors in a few parts, but it's only tiny.

Overall rating: "Moonlight" is an original film that stays away from following a predicable path. I thought this was absolutely mesmerizing and was quite the experience that I didn't expect.
Moonlight is poetic, raw and personal. The story is bold and moving, encompassing rare emotions and struggles. Both the acting and direction have many subtleties that are poignant and resounding. Moonlight is one of the year's best films and one that should be experienced. 9.5/10
Amazing group of actors.
A subtle yet powerful indictment of the toxic masculinity that pervades our society, told through a story that I have never before seen in a film and that I doubt has ever been told through film before.
Outstanding film making ... Didn't live every part of the movie but pretty good nevertheless
Amazing movie. Really conveys an amazing message, or more like a reminder. Life is not always how we imagine it and Barry Jenkins shows us an amazing story. One that could be happening out there today, right now. It blows your mind in ways. Also, must add that it was such a pleasure to watch this film. Makes me believe cinematography is not dead...we need more movies like this. The scenes were amazing, lighting was awesome and the music choices are on point too. Moments of silence in the movie spoke louder thn any monologue or dialogue I've seen. Thank you Mr. Jenkins.
Quite simply the best movie of the year.  This movie makes you feel something at all times;  The director has done an amazing jobs of making the characters age seamlessly even though 3 different actors play two of the parts.  Fantastic.
An emotional and beautiful portrait of a repressed gay man and the hardships of his life. The acting was on fire but the story felt very dragged out.
They're back!!! #ShortnMediocreReviewsByLauren
Moonlight is a much watch!! MUST. I don't think I've ever watched anything quite like this film. The intimacy and importance of every. single. scene... I'm still thinking about it 3 days later. Special shoutout to the cinematography, teenage Chiron, and Mahershala Ali. Thank you Barry Jenkins and Tarrell McCraney for bringing your personal stories to the silver screen. This film is SO RELEVANT.
It's really long and slow but it really does shed light on a black man's lifestyle that not many of us get to see 
It plays like an opera; act 1. little, act 2. Chiron, act 3. black
We follow this character from a troubled youth to a fully-grown man trying to make his way in a rough world 
One thing is for sure is that it's hard to be a black man in America, particularly when you're questioning your sexual orientation
Chiron comes to terms with himself, his best friend, school bullies and his heavily-flawed mother
The writing here says it's hard to be your true self when at times you're moonlighting as whoever everyone expects you to be
Gritty, raw, emotional and outspoken
Great storytelling with lots of raw emotion. I'd definitely recommend it.
His story is all too familiar. Great movie!
The most boring movie I have ever seen.
Subtlety. It's a rare commodity in film. Most movies seem to feel that they have to beat the Movie Fan over the head with their message - or are so loud and/or flashy that the Movie Fan doesn't really get much of a chance to consider the message. Making a movie built around the concept of subtlety takes talent, patience and guts. "Moonlight" (R, 1:51) is such a film. It's the story of a black boy growing up in Miami and learning to deal with the challenges of being raised by a drug-addicted mother, getting bullied by his classmates for being different and trying to come to terms with his sexuality and find his place in the world. This movie, loosely based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unproduced play entitled "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue", comes right out and tells us very little... but manages to say much. 

The film, adapted and directed by Barry Jenkins, is divided into three distinct sections, each opening with a black title card and white letters which give us only the number of that particular chapter and that chapter's name - the name that Chiron, the main character, is known by during that period in his life. "i. Little" introduces us to Chiron (Alex Hibbert), a small, quite boy who seems to get no joy from life. He has only one friend, a boy named Kevin (Jaden Piner), and is constantly bullied by the other kids. Chiron's mother (Naomie Harris) alternates between neglecting and verbally abusing him. "Little" meets a drug dealer named Juan (an Oscar-worthy Mahershala Ali) who becomes a father figure to Little and encourages him, with the help of Juan's kindly girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monáe), at whose house Little sometimes also gets a meal and has a place to sleep when things get especially bad with his mother.

"ii. Chiron" features a teenage Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders), who is as joyless and nearly as quiet as he was when he was known in the neighborhood as "Little". His mother has become even more desperate and pathetic, and the bullying continues, but with more severe consequences. Chiron maintains his relationship with the few positive influences in his life, especially Teresa and Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), who are the only two people who seem to really understand Chiron and accept him for who he is. In "iii. Black", Chiron (Trevante Rhodes), now going by the nickname that Kevin gave him years earlier, has moved to Atlanta, but takes advantage of an opportunity to reunite with Kevin (André Holland). Seeing how these two young men turned out continues to showcase this film's subtle storytelling style.

"Moonlight" is an artful, subtle and powerful film. The three actors who played Chiron at different ages were chosen not so much for their overall physical resemblance to each other, but based on the similarities in their eyes, which are easy to notice in the movie poster. Beyond that, the three actors (as well as the three actors who played Kevin) had no contact with the others playing their character during filming, allowing all of them to portray their own interpretations of their character. Those eyes and those character portrayals effectively and engagingly tell an especially potent coming-of-age story, while Jenkins gives us an artful, creative and unforgettable film. "A"
First scene was amazing, set a tone that the rest of the film could not live up to. 

Slow, ambivalent plot and character development along with very disjointed progression of main characters story line left me feeling that too many complex social issues were being crammed into what amounted to some pretty lazy story telling. 

Not a total flop, but it wasnt until about 2/3rds into the movie that a rather major yet constrained theme about homosexuality and black masculinity revealed themselves in full light to the audience. 

After a while, the movie felt like a non starter that just needed to end if it wasnt going to go as far as it could have.
To be honest, this movie did absolutely nothing for me.
I didn't care for it one bit.
It is nothing but a horrid depressing film that makes you feel like shit the whole way through.
I would give this zero stars if I can.
And nothing at all would make me accept it as 2016's Best Picture.
I will never accept it, I will only accept La La Land as my Best Picture of 2016.
And I will also never accept it as the first LGBT film to win best picture, because it should have been Brokeback Mountain, but lost to the god-awful Crash.
Moonlight is the Crash of the Oscars.
It will go down as one of my most hated films of all time.
Not a terrible movie it just doesn't lead to anything.
Great look into inner city life and the dead end many minorities face.  We see Chiron (main character) go from elementary school to a full grown man and the struggles in between.  Gritty, dark, but a good movie.
Terrific story, great actors playing the lead
Moonlight is an excellent film that anyone that wants to understand race and the difficulties of being a minority represents. This is a movie about the challenge of being different in an already depressed and conflicted community. It talks about the impossibility of being yourself, the danger of authenticity and the devastating effects of the failures in our social fabric. Extraordinary.
A thought provoking tale that was intimately, lovingly shot allowing us to feel the fear, the love, the discomfort, and the struggle of one person's journey to himself.
Best performances of the year. Beautiful camera work and mise-en-scene. The script was emotive and effective in how it utilizes silence and its economy of dialogue. 
Obviously, its also incredible that an indie film dealing with issues of intersectionality (sexuality, class, gender, race) has come into such prominence. At first it may appear that its reinforcing certain stereotypes (drug addict mother, drug dealing father figure) but the way Jenkins deals with the subject matters is anything but stereotypical or conventional, as the dominant frameworks we're used to seeing in the mainstream hardly ever occupy the gaze of a racialized and marginalized character, like it does here
A well-told treatise on what's it like to be black and gay in America.  Great performances all around. Good soundtrack. (11-13-16)
It was a great movie, but I don't understand went Ali received the Oscar best supporter award.  I didn't feel his character affected Chiron in the long run.  Also, the media gave the impression that it focused on a gay man.  Yes, it was about a guy who would eventually would become gay, but I didn't see it enough.  This story felt like Kendrick Lamar wrote this script if you take out the gay theme.
This is a singular, special gem of a movie. It's sparse but rich; complex in its simplicity; beautiful, and hopeful. It defies expectations, and I'm regretful for ever even having my (still high, but predictable) expectations in the first place.

Please see this movie!
After all of the rapturous reviews, my expectations were high. Alas, I didn't love it. The character in the 1st two segments was mostly unrelatable to me and I found him unlikable. I did enjoy the last segment, but even it was slow going.
Easily the best movie we've seen this year. The performances deserve multiple Oscar nods.
Truly moving story that needed to be told. powerful characters and breathtaking cinematography. visually enticing and unforgettable. recommend that everyone go watch
An uncompromising narrative exploring masculinity, sexuality and survival.
sort of boring.  v depressing.  Not a good combo.
This movie was fine, but you must admit they saved money on dialogue.  One thing it is not: the one and only movie you should see this year.  The acting was fine, and the performances of young cast members were remarkable.  But when EVERYONE is calling something a masterpiece, it should be.
What a beautiful movie both in the way it looks and for the performances. My favorite so far this year. The acting is just amazing from all. The subject matter may seem like been there done that, but it is such a refreshing original angel on it. My heart broke in all three stories of this man's life. The film is shot so gorgeous. The photographer in me loved that. They dont make movies like this anymore where there is such a development of a character. The pace is slow, but i dont mind that at all. Last scene of the movie is just so incredibly sad but uplifting at same time. I really hope this finds an audience and sweeps the awards.
This film focuses on an interesting story of self discovery, though many characters remain undeveloped leaving the viewer wondering at the end what happened. The subject of the film, though, is well developed by the end and the viewer will cheer for him.
This movie was dragged out with no real point to it. It was slow and had no ending. The only good part was the first 15-20 minutes. Very disappointed
The most emotional I have gotten in a theater throughout the entire year of 2016. Moonlight is a near perfect film with terrific acting across the board. It's a tragic story that has just enough optimism in it that allows you to leave the theater shaken yet hopeful. 9.2/10
Great movie.   It left me breathless.  The movie stayed in me and just kept me thinking about it.  Loved it.
What a really great movie. Acting, music, plot and cinematography all superb!
In a year when big budget blockbusters garner all the attention, its this small movie about life and growth that stands far above everything else. 

I can go on and on about all the reasons why I absolutely loved this film, but do yourself a favor and go support this film! Have an open heart, an open mind, and prepare to see life from a different point of view.
First - this has moments of transcendent beauty, primarily because of the visualization by Jenkins. He uses all the tools cinema affords him - power of the singular image, complex emotional/psychological expression of montage, exquisite sound design. But the transcendence wouldn't be possible without flawless performances (crafted by on-set pacing and editing in-camera). All incarnations of Chiron are perfect. The pacing is wise, intuitive, and unteachable. Jenkins is clearly a talent who, hopefully, has a long, prolific career ahead of him. The triptych structure of the narrative contributes to how fluid and engrossing it is. The minutes fly by. Could've watched three hours of this. The ending offers such subtle catharsis. My love will grow overtime. Masterpiece.
Incredibly simple. No dialogue. Characters come and leave without resolution. No character growth.   Guns come and go with no relevance or application. Worst movie I have seen this year.
This movie is so good, the first 15 minutes build-up had me so enticed despite its simplicity, this movie delves into something so unique, something that movies really don't ever venture into;
The cycle of a man's life, a drug dealer and a drug taker raising a young gay boy into a young gay teen into a drug dealer limited of his sexuality.

This film explains in such a brutal way that your upbringing creates you, if you get called a Faggot enough times, you will question it, you get called "Black" enough times, you just accept it. As Kevin says at the end of the film "Who are you [Chiron]?" in which he replies with "I'm just me", an innocent boy bullied with a mother he hates will produce a different man. I don't fully believe this film quite follows the narrow description of "a movie about two gay black boys" rather you become what you see. Kevin punching Chiron in the face isn't what he wanted, its what he is, his compassionate attitude towards Chiron cannot uphold in the life he made for himself, there is a serious struggle and limitation with trying to pursue a gay lifestyle in the black community, which is why Kevin as a man completely neglects it by having a kid.

9/10 - Strong message and not a "gay-bait" movie.
Real. Tragic. Just enough moments of beauty and hope to get you through and leave you feeling rewarded.
Purely exquisite. I left the theatre will such satisfaction and a knowing smile. A movie I'll never forget. If the Oscar's overlook this, I'll lose all faith in them.
A new trope from a different point of view, but very slow moving.
Deeply, humanely, tragically moving. A genuinely great film that is haunted me ever since I saw it.
As humanist a movie as you can get. It's small but impeccable with astounding acting.
A tale about masculinity and the mystery of love, Moonlight is a unique vision painted by a man who knows exactly what film he wants to make and knows exactly how to do it. It's not exactly revolutionary, but it's extremely important and just plain beautiful, in more ways than one.
He is very different. Great two thumbs up? LOL
A look at African American culture from a completely different perspective.
This is a quiet movie that sinks in slowly. I find myself thinking back on it many days later. Have tried to explain it to others and struggle to describe.  It has cliches but then counters stereotypes. Its simplicity in storytelling only strengthens the complexity of what is revealed. It's a coming of age tale, but really more a coming to self.
Hands down one of the Top 4 best movies of 2016. Shocking and sad.
A quiet and gentle boy try's to make sense of his life all while attempting to survive in his impoverished community. Living as a lonely, latch key kid with a mother who falls prey to drug addiction Chiron doesn't have the luxury of being his authentic self as a gay young man. He only knows that he must survive by any means necessary.
A sad, sweet and very humanizing character study. Great care put to a subject and a class of person you rarely (if ever) see shown in an empathetic light. It's refreshing to see this story told without a downward  or white gaze - we're all humans, we all have emotions, we all blindly follow paths in life we don't realize we more control over than we think.
Wow!  Beautiful film making with a real punch!  I don't believe that I have ever seen a film that says so much, about so many different themes,  with such effortlessness. Mr. Jenkins has made a film with an unflinching eye on what it means to be black, male, gay, drug-addicted, and poor in America.  The entire cast is perfectly cast, with stand out performances by the three actors who play Chiron (Hibbert, Sanders, and Rhodes), Naomie Harris, Andre Holland, and Mahershala Ali.
What a beautiful film. Slow and moving. Exposes the realistic difficulties men may feel in their own environment and their sexuality.
As the Oscar season begins, Moonlight sets a high bar for the films that will follow.
I appreciated deeply this movie. The way it was done. The pace. The content revealing the journey of this young black boy into adulthood. A meaningful, powerful, real, touching, heart felt movie. Slow paced like a gourmet European meal where time is taken to appreciate and be with. Primo of a movie.
Best movie I've seen this year. :)
Very poignant... artfully crafted
"Moonlight" is indie at its finest! The thing is it deserves all the recognition it is getting. Spanning through 3 decades in our protagonists life, it shows so many important aspects of living life in America right now as a black person. The thing is, so many things are expected from a black man, and "Moonlight" is right here to assure us that no one should be expected to be a certain way. It demolishes all prejudice and stands as an important message againt bullying. It's tough at times, raw, sweet, honest and in every-way beautiful. Great performances by the whole cast, it looks like they all love what they're doing. It just is so meaningful and important!
This was a beautiful, amazing movie that everybody should see.  The musical score (as well as the classic R&B singles played throughout) was perfect.
Solid movie with great acting and directing. It's not the great movie as everyone is making it out to be, but it does provide a small window into what it's like being a gay black man growing up in the hood, something I don't think has been done in film.
The particular story of a black family situation.
It's about time Black people get a film that shows tender and sweetness.
So affecting, achingly authentic, an incredible film that is as heartbreaking as it is beautiful.
Moonlight: This is a matter-of-fact, three act portrait of Chiron, first as a young Miami boy attempting to survive his crack-addicted mother, then later as a teen battling neighborhood bullies as he struggles with his sexual identity. It is heartbreaking as you realize nearly everyone in Chiron's life has or will fail him, leaving him with scars that will shape his adult life (act three). The story's gritty, realistic feel could have benefited from some editing and the actors playing teen and adult Chiron are so physically different it detracts from the powerful story. (Janelle Monáe was a nice surprise, however.) Still, this haunting, thought-provoking film will linger in your mind long after you see it, making it among the year's best. A

Anthologies that jump through time or even change direction to focus on new character can be very hard to accomplish. The biggest worry is that the story to follow is not quite as engaging as its previous one. In the same vein as films like The Place Beyond the Pines, Moonlight has three core stories, focussing on one character as his life changes throughout decades. Unless you are willing to watch a film that takes its time, has little to no score, and serves as a building of character, rather than a dramatic thriller, then I truly believe you will be bored and not quite feel the impact. That being said, if you are in the right mindset to watch this film, it may very well just be the best film you will see all year. Here is why Moonlight stands as one of the greatest films of 2016

In this very strict three act feature, we follow Chiron (also known as Little or Black throughout his life) as he deals with a single parent who is struggling with drugs and wants nothing to do with him. On top of that, his fear of being ridiculed and beaten for being gay escalates rapidly day by day. Running into Juan and Teresa, a couple who becomes hellbent on raising Chiron in times of need, this adds some much needed levity to some very touchy subject matter. Their presence added to the emotional core of this story in the best way possible. Without giving too much of the film away, act one sees Chiron as an adolescent, act two as a teenager, and act three as a grown man. Each decade features him in a different light than the last, but you will feel as though every one of his arcs are earned. This is one of the most realistic characters I have seen on screen all year.

If this premise doesn't already have you hooked, then I have to admit this film is not for you. That being said, if I have your attention, lets dive into a bit of detail on how certain elements are jaw-droopingly beautiful throughout the film. From the very first frame, you can tell the cinematographer wanted to capture every necessary in each individual frame. The shot-planning throughout is absolutely masterful. Being unstable when necessary, providing Mise En Scene to scenes that would only make a film lover become invested even more, and having a sense of calm in scenes that required nothing but silence or dialogue between characters to move a scene along, the technical aspects of this film are beyond perfect to say the least. From the sound of waves crashing to the subtlety of a frame being out of focus to reveal that a character feels uneasy, there is so much to take in. 

The biggest question I had when the first act finished, was if it was going to feel like an effective journey through Chiron's life. While I did find one aspect with the character of Juan to be a little incomplete, that is a very minor complaint in an otherwise spectacular picture. From beginning to end, the casting is fantastic and you truly believe that the cameras were rolling throughout their entire lives. This may be a stretch, but I think they pulled off what the film Boyhood needed 12 years to accomplish, while recasting the main character three times. Now, Boyhood was one of my favourite films of 2014, so I am just using it as an example, but that just goes to show how impressive Moonlight is as a whole. From beginning to end, every moment serves a purpose for the over-arching story. I could not be happier with this finished product. 

From incredibly believable performances, to wonderful storytelling, to superb direction and technical perfection when it came to its sound, Moonlight is easily one of my favourite films of the year. It may not be for everyone, but anyone who can put themselves in the proper mood to watch a film like this, or is a film lover in general, I don't see how you can dislike this picture. Every aspect is done with care and the filmmakers, especially Barry Jenkins, who wrote and directed this film, gives his all in creating an emotional, moving feature film. Moonlight is one of the quietest films I have seen in years, and yet, it is one of the most engaging. These characters are so well-written that it almost feels like a true story at times. Moonlight is not only a superb drama, but a beautiful and near perfect film in general. Highly recommended if you know what you are getting into.
A quietly emotionally charged masterpiece, Moonlight takes you into the difficult life of Chiron. Great story-telling, camera work, and acting all around. The struggles of Chiron are very real and portrayed as so. It gives the audience all the chills in the world when Little walks away from the table open learning Juan sells drugs, and again bring out all the emotions in the audience when at the end the re-imagined, now respected and feared, Chiron turns out to be that same quiet kid that is just trying to survive. Steady and powerful.
One of the best I have seen this year. Touching, timely, honest.
Very strong, good movie.
"Moonlight" doesn't drown you in ideology like you presume it might; it instead lowers you into a warm pool of in-motion aesthetic where the chlorine has been removed, leaving only the very bacteria that let us live in the first place.
Overdone romantic biography suffers from lack of strong editing - if 20 minutes had been cut this might have been a decent movie.  The first two thirds moves reasonably well, but the last third is so overlong it insults the audience.  Decent acting job ruined by overlong shots intended to darken an already bleak depiction.  Under no circumstance see this movie if you have a hint of depression.  Overrated.
beautiful film about self discovery, facades, and love. revelatory cast.
'MOONLIGHT' is a cinematic experience that transcend its' own social constraints to live with its' own pulsing heartbeat; Such intricacy of humanity has seldom been as magnificently portrayed. Director Barry Jenkins' narrative studies the life of a beautiful man, examining his hardships and finding strength in his reality. The film is poetic, wordlessly delicate yet fierce and uncompromising, and the performances by all are exquisite -- most notably that of Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes. This is a film that speaks of purest artistry and celebrates the beauty of life that triumphs despite current political tyranny.
A triumph of filmmaking, a story of depth far beyond movie cliches.
Exquisitely raw and poignant . His eyes tear emotion, without speaking a word. Beautifully scripted and very strong performances. I was still crying after leaving the theatre. One of a kind
This is probably the best movie of the year.  I can't stop thinking about it.  It is not a standard coming of age flim (one of my favorite genres) but a slice of life many of us know nothing about.  The performances were superb.  Don't msi s it.
Moving and powerful.
The subject matter and perspective were novel, but ultimately, it was pretty slow and uneventful. Insignificant detail, but it drove me nuts how the boy from the second chapter looked nothing like the actors from the other chapters. Just sayin'.
An incredibly well-acted film with a poignant message and an interesting way of laying out its plot. While it's never boring, it also suffers from the shyness of its main character, as while he keeps his fellow characters at a distance, so does the filmmaker in regards to the audience and the main character. It has a charming and refreshing sense of humor, but its imagery is cliche and its ending a little too obvious when it comes to symbolism. For the most part, though, a captivating and well-made movie with a strong message.
what an emotionally charged film
Director Barry Jenkins takes his time constructing a narrative, slowly giving details that subtly pop up later in his story. It's a visual tableau utilizing color and contrast to create a distinct aesthetic for each of the three chapters. In this way, Jenkins imbues his rough, urban landscape with a gorgeous poetic sheen. The atmosphere has an increasingly dreamlike state. It's a leisurely paced drama where silence speaks volumes. It's a meditative reflection where moody rhythms percolate beneath the protagonist's circumstances. Jenkins touches on poverty, race, gender, sexuality, masculinity and identity. None of this is overt, but rather develops organically as it would when fulfilling one's own life. Jenkins inspires many questions: Who are we as a person? Are we the product of our environment? Can we rise above these obstacles? How do these events shape us into the adult we become? There are many more. Some appear to have answers. Others are open to interpretation. Chiron's experiences will touch each viewer in different ways that will encourage reflection for days afterward. His struggle may not be yours. However, it still involves the combustible components that are part of every human endeavor. In this way, Jenkins imparts a movie that speaks for all humanity.

Excellent movie.  Really enjoy it. You should definitely see this one
Unconventional love story. Thought provoking.
Went to see this movie tonight.  I think the plot was very original in that it showed someone's life in three parts.  It was well acted by the whole cast.  Very believable.  There was some awkward moments in the film and some points in which the film didn't show that would have made it better.  I must admit the ending had me like what the.... was that it?  Over all it was a good coming of age movie.  Real impressed with Janelle's acting chops?
Moonlight was a lot different than I expected and when first leaving the theater I did not feel it was worth all of the acclaim that it has been getting. Now that some time has settled I think that the movie was very good. An Oscar contender maybe...the winner I dont believe so. 

Nonetheless the film tells the story in 3 phases of Chiron; as a child, teenager and adult. The movie explores what it is like growing up and being bullied in an African American neighborhood. It is about a boy who cannot be himself because everything around him is telling him to be somebody else. Chiron struggles with being reserved in a brutal neighborhood, he struggles with his sexuality, and he struggles with home life, and he struggles with finding himself. 

The movie is emotional in that you can feel what Chiron feels. The acting is top notch and the story is an important one to tell. The problem is with the odd cinematography that attempts to be unique but comes off at jerky and not fluid. The film also does not have a lot of direction. The first two acts are near perfect, with the third losing the steam. A good film worth watching, but short of perfect.
Quietly powerful! Beautiful imagery! Perfectly scored!  I've seen this film three times and I'm still moved as if it were the first. Not to be missed!
A movie for feeling first and thinking about later -- but one that never reduces itself to telling.  Everything comes through light, color, sound, skin.
Never has there been a movie about a coming of age story of a black American male that tells a story of black masculinity without being derivative. Little.  Chiron.  Black.  3 stories of the same man, who faces issues of love, family, and self...he speaks so few words, but the movie speaks volumes.  I was left crying, tears of pain, of remembering, of joy, of sadness, of laughter.  But at the end, it was the feeling of knowing that I am not the only one that really touched my heart.
A masterpiece in storytelling and character development
Beautiful!  (And Sofia Coppola was sitting in the row behind us.)
Slow paced, quiet, raw, and creepingly emotional. Stories like these need to be told on screen.
A really beautifully, well crafted film, well worth seeing. CDW
I saw "Moonlight" last night. It is a beautiful work of art. The visuals were classic. The soundtrack danced along graciously with the film. The story well written. The acting superb. The humanity heartfelt. The cinematography fluid and purposeful. Wonderful film overall. Movie making at its best.

The story...
A young boy, Chiron, is grappling with understanding his life while dealing with no father, a drug addict mother and abusive children. Along the way, he meets Juan, a drug dealer, who becomes a savior of sorts. Juan and his girlfriend are attentive, compassionate and accepting of Chiron. Their home becomes a safe haven for this young boy to escape the rants of his mom and the school/neighborhood bullies he encounters on a daily basis. As he enters adolescence he is faced with tackling feelings about another boy, his friend Kevin. Kevin invites Chiron to experience some thing with him that makes sense and brings a bit of light to his dull existence. Unfortunately forces around Chiron bare down, suffocating that small spark that has been kindled and his life takes a turn for the worse. As an adult, we discover as a very different character, following the footsteps of Juan into a life that may not be meant for him. As he moves along this path an unexpected opportunity presents it self and this young man can once again see light in his dim routine world.

Warning: This film has an ending that I believe is just right though others may feel leaves them hanging.
Brokeback Mountain meets Boyz N the Hood.  Spike Lee with a violin section.
very moving I greatly enjoyed it yet I am sad that many males especially in the black community won't see it because the story is homosexual
Very good acting and a great story. Didn't really capitalize on his sexuality fully even tho it was the premise of the movie . Didn't capture it at all when he was an adult. Not nearly as great as the reviews say. It's just too boring! Typically a movie about sexuality has a little more sexuality in it lol . Not saying it should've been soft porn but something to keep our attention. An interaction with a girl would've been nice too ; considering he was "confused " about his sexuality. A compare contrast type scene. Scenes instead were drawn out with a main character that can't say more than 5 words in a single sentence. Actors were on point but writers n producers were not !
Unbelievably first class actors, writers and director. I initially didn't want to see the film but surprisingly I fell in love with it.  Excellent film
There is no other word besides beautiful to describe this film. A perfectly realized portrayal of how one's distraught childhood can alter life's path for an individual.
This movie gives us an intense, well-layered narrative of the struggles of black masculinity and sexuality. I would be saddened if this movie doesn't make the Oscar contender's list.
A special movie. Wonderful acting, poignant story., sad insight into growing up poor in a still segregated world. Superb and  effective use of mix of music, some unexpected but perfectly melded to the story.
It's rare when I don't really enjoy a movie that has gotten amazing reviews. I just didn't connect with this at all. I will say I enjoyed the acting very much. All were great. Naomie Harris was the stand out for me & wouldn't mind if she got the Oscar for this role. Mahershala Ali was good but his role was too small to leave a lasting impression on me. When it comes to Supporting Actors he isn't a stand out for me of the year. The music was also great. But that's about all I liked from the movie. Sad to say. Normally I don't want to say too many negative things about a movie when I don't like it, but since this one is gonna get a lot of Oscar love I just feel like I need to explain why I didn't like it. I'll try to keep it short. While this was amazing subject matter, had so much potential, I felt the storytelling & filming fell short. It was so slow. While it is a grim story I felt no emotional connection. Things would happen without explanation. Also the dialogue wasn't for me. The camerawork also made me a bit sick. The constant spinning, the blurry shots, made my eyes hurt. I will say there were at least 3 absolutely stunning shots though. But the camerawork pulled me out of the movie too much. I am glad this movie was made & hope it opens the door for more stories like this. But I can't just say it's great for the story it was trying to tell, this movie in it's entirety just didn't work for me. Especially compared to all the other movies that came out this year. This isn't a Best Picture for me, this isn't a movie I will buy, cause I honestly don't see myself watching this again. Never know though, you might love it.
It's Boyhood, but with diversity, powerful lead performances, and mesmerizing camera work.
Reeling.  I'm not sure I've ever seen such a sad, bleak and dark film portrayed so beautifully.  GODDAMN.

"It may cast a spell on anyone who has known loneliness, exclusion, feelings of inferiority or a desire to be encased in a hard shell to protect a soft interior."
Magnificent. Powerful. Moving. Stunningly beautiful. I can't sing the praises of this movie enough. It's full of feeling and warmth.
99% on Rotten Tomatoes... Where they do that at? This film earned every bit of it. Beautiful is one word for it.
A beautiful piece of independent cinematographic art Moonlight is touching, though-provoking and extraordinary movie. A magnificent blend of acting, directing and camera-work, this is an intimate and personal story which works as a strikingly realistic essay on social, racial and sexual tensions in the post-modern US society. 
The story of young Afro-American Chiron and his struggle to find his place in society, to express and to accept his sexuality is told in three different stages of his life. Tensed and yet gentle, the story is disturbingly painful as it delves into the themes of race, sexuality and isolation. Still, every minute of Barry Jenkins' story is told in a delicate, beautifully crafted manner which also allow the cast to shine in their outstanding performances. Naomi Harris, Ashton Sanders (teen Chiron), Trevante Rhodes (adult Chiron) and of course Maherashala Ali stun with their on-screen presences. None of them truly shines on his own, but together as a team, with their restrained, but deeply emotional performances, they succeeds to provide the final element to Barry Jenkins' flawless movie: the acting. Acting as human beings, acting as people who are part of this story and not only people getting into specific characters. 
Speaking Maherashala Ali, especially after his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, it should be noted the impact which he has on the movie. Even with his limited participation, his embodiment of a drug dealer with a human dignity and love for other human beings is one of the most striking things you will see in a movie. Touching, loving and caring, he is among the most unorthodox drug dealers you would ever see on the screen, while remaining absolutely convincing and realistic as a character.
In conclusion, Moonlight is a most delightful and unforgettable example of independent quality film-making. Touching, gut-wrenching and unforgettably intimate, this is a magnificent poem-turned-into-movie about American reality, sexuality and social tension. A most deserved Oscar Best Movie winner, this is a must see modern classic.
A slow, deliberate and very well told story that would be ideal for any gay film festival because it deals with a topic often hidden from public view but the fact that it is being released wide in theaters speaks even more to its power and message. It does a remarkable job of telling the story at three distinct separate stages of a young man's life..., as a child, as an adolescent teenager and then as a young man. The barriers thrown at him and also the lifelines of his journey feel very real and believeable.
this movie had some good scenes - one involving a bully and a chair springs to mind - but often felt contrived and failed to meet my high expectations. That said, it was OK. The popcorn at cineplex odeon 55 bloor st w was very stale and poor quality which is disappointing since it cost me almost 10 bucks
Best film I e seen in years. I'm calling it Brokeblack Mountain.
Best movie of the month of October....See it!
I finally got the chance to watch one of my most anticipated movies from last year: Moonlight and OH BOY did it meet all my expectations and the hype I had for it. Many lgbtq stories portrayed on the media, either on film or tv tend to be quite melodramatic, stereotypical or even worse, always inclined to have a TRAGIC outcome, while I recognize the importance of having those type of stories told, cause they do happen and sadly on a daily basis around the world, most of the times they end up feeling very exploitative and like they were made for all the wrong reasons, here, the director, Barry Jenkins with his amazing cast, and a wonderful script, achieve something remarkable with a simple coming of age story, they created something that actually feels very pure, real and genuine in a poetic kind of way, we have this mix of both beautiful and really intense scenes interwined that develop organically during the course of the three acts of the movie, that see our main character Chairon at three different stages of his life; major shoutout to the casting director for not only having an outstanding supporting cast in Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae and Mahershala Ali, but for finding the three young actors that make the protagonist of this story seamlessly grow up before our eyes without missing a beat. It is so refreshing that a movie like this exists, right here, right now, Its heart is in all the right places which makes this small intimate story feel larger than life with its very timely universal themes. I encourage everyone to watch it, as I find this an essential work of art ??????????
To say that MOONLIGHT is an LGBT-themed movie about a black youth, growing up in Miami, is not to say anything at all. It is heart-wrenchingly beautiful; it defies all stereotypes with a unique set of brush strokes and textures; and it transform the viewer inexplicably in the process. It is breathtaking! MOONLIGHT is a must-see cinematic masterpiece that will nourish your human soul.
Worth you time and money.... and a lesson to all people. This movie illustrates what it is to be African American Masculine and to struggle with ones sexuality, local surrroundings, and just growing up. This is the tale of many peoples past and a reflection like the moonlight to the story the can become.
To put it simply, a realistic masterpiece of a film.
Although there are holes as a result of skipping decades, this is a good movie. And, more than that, important.
Boring as hell. Couldn't finish it.
Moonlight is a drama with a delicate theme set in a difficult situation. We look into 3 parts of the life of Chiron, a boy growing up in the hood and struggling to find himself. Friendship, love and sexuality is the overall focus here, from parental care to first love. It begins when he tries to find a better mother and father role in his life. Second comes the teenager phase and brutal bullying in school, first love and sexual encounter. Last is the part where Chiron is an adult and reconnects with his old friend. We see patterns of his childhood reflected in his own adult life, this is displayed very well. It is a difficult theme and it is paired pretty well with the tough life in the hood, but overall this movie wasn't as good for me as many say. I'd say for me it was more average than extraordinary.
Unconventional love story with a lot of biographical background. It is a bit episodic but the power of its ending is not diminished.
One of most powerful and artful films I've seen in a long time
Amazing movie that has stayed with me since seeing it a month ago. The performances of each actor are amazing.
Nuanced, beautifully photographed film ... best of the year so far
Yup, the best movie I've seen this year. The story is so unbelievably touching. The actors are all superb. I really hope this goes on to win lots of awards, and get seen by many people. It tackles issues that include bullying, homophobia, racism, and the limited options for people who grow up in poor neighborhoods. It also reminded me what it was like to grow up as the closeted homosexual runt.
THE TIDE IS HIGH - My Review of MOONLIGHT (4 1/2 Stars)

It's been 8 years since writer/director Barry Jenkins made his feature debut with MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY, from which he became an indie darling for a hot second and then disappeared for a long, dry spell.  The fact that he's returned to such high acclaim with the poetic, blazing, emotionally resonant MOONLIGHT gives guys like me, who haven't directed a feature in 4 years, some hope that if you put your guts into something, people just may respond.  

That's exactly what Jenkins has done here, adapting Tarell McCraney's unproduced play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue to glorious effect and giving us one of the best films of the year in the process. The story, told in three parts of one man's life, sounds on paper like your typical coming-of-age drama.  Our hero, Chiron, appears as a young boy, a teenager, and a grown man in his 20s, with each section titled by his nicknames or his real name, 1) Little, 2) Chiron, and 3) Black.  Despite the fact that he's gay, Chiron's journey of discovery isn't so much about coming to terms with his sexuality as much as it's about finding ways to adapt in order to survive.  

In the first section, he's a sullen, quiet kid raised in the poor section of Miami. He's played with quiet command by Alex R. Hibbert who runs from bullies who call him "soft", avoids his negligent, drug-addicted mom (a sensational Naomi Harris of SKYFALL fame), and finds mentors of sorts with the neighborhood drug dealer (Mahershala Ali, so good in HOUSE OF CARDS and showing incredible versatility here) and his girlfriend Teresa (singer Janelle Monáe in an impressively assured acting debut).   MOONLIGHT is quiet, contemplative, and languid, filled with slyly observed moments which would not seem out of place in a Terrence Malick film were the emotions much more accessible here.  In fact, I found the tone of this film to be a unique achievement.  Despite similarities to the work of the aforementioned Malick, as well as the work of War Wong Kai, Jenkins finds a rhythm and pace I can only call Jenkinsian.  He gets his own genre!!  It's arty without being pretentious because the characters feel so vivid and true.   

The first part sets the stage for things to come in this young man's life, where a kind of loving support comes from unexpected places and a budding friendship emerges with the gregarious Kevin (Jaden Piner as the child version) that will help and challenge his questions of identity.  One startling scene shows Chiron asking Juan, his drug-dealing mentor, what a faggot is.  Juan's response came as a big surprise, as do the scenes in which their relationship blossoms.  

The second part highlights the incessant bullying Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) suffers in high school, culminating in a shocking, gut-wrenching sequence.  Filled with violence and betrayal, it's a galvanizing moment guaranteed to make you sit up and realize you've been mesmerized by the slow pace until now.  His troubles at home intensify as well, with his friendship with Kevin (winningly played as a teen by Jharrel Jerome) running the emotional gamut and leaving you spent by the time this section fades out.  

Finally, the third part gives us adult Chiron, and his transformation is staggering.  With quiet command, echoed beautifully by the younger actors playing the role, Trevante Rhodes, looking like a very buff, even sexier Fifty Cent, savors the gorgeous patience and curiosity as he tracks down a person from his past, played with bottomless charm by André Holland.  Unlike the prior sections, this part of the movie plays out almost in real time, culminating in a standout restaurant scene in which two old friends seemingly discover each other for the first time.  The film goes out as quietly as it came in, knowing it has something to say, and not in a hurry to impress you.  Because of its intelligence and patience, it bowls you over.  
Major credit must go to cinematographer James Laxton, A Kevin Smith collaborator, who swirls his camera around the characters and feels like he's breathing right with them.  It's a great dance and an astonishing calling card for this talented artist.  Same goes for the score by Nicholas Britell, which delivers one unexpected and meaningful cue after another along with song choices that startle, such as the opening rap number, or give you a lump in your throat, such as a certain jukebox selection.  Also, I was amazed to hear that Naomi Harris shot her part in just three days.  It's Oscar worthy work and I can only imagine the rollercoaster of emotions she must have felt shooting so fast, but this is a performance to remember.  

MOONLIGHT isn't the fastest film or the most articulate.  So much of its power comes from wordless moments or evocative shots.  It's not perfect, but what it shows of the black male experience in America, what it displays in sheer artistry, and how it leaves you feeling like you understand a person beneath the facade they project, is what makes it essential viewing.
This is an astonishing and devastating film.  Beautiful, emotionally-rich, and true but in a subtle way.  I wept.
These stories need to be told to rid the stigma of homophobia in the African American community!!
Thought provoking and very human!
Great job!
One of the most important films of the decade.
Outstanding dramatic film. Mahershala Ali & Naomie Harris are wonderful.
'Moonlight' gives a voice to the voiceless in a film that chronicles the lives of ordinary people in extraordinary ways. Our entry point to the story is young Chiron, who also goes by the name of Little and Black. We meet him as a grade schooler initially and see him evolve over the course of 20 years as he discovers his manhood, his sexuality and, ultimately, his reason for being. Writer-director Barry Jenkins, in his second feature, brings a palatable weight and gravity to the proceedings and gives us a cinematic offering of the highest order. Touching character moments and emotional beats help to transcend this story that, in lesser hands, may have been much more of a middling effort. Jenkins really knows how to compose a shot as his cinematography is graceful and immersive. Chiron is a very relatable character as he is meant to represent all average kids growing up in difficult circumstances. The fact that he is gay and black is not the only remarkable aspect of his livelihood. Marred by a crack-addled mother, he spends the film trying to defy his upbringing and attempts to not succumb to the life that was laid out for him. Altogether, a very grounded and exploratory work that demands attention while making you tear by film's end for sure. It's been favorably compared to Richard Linklater's star-studded 'Boyhood' and for good reason. This is a coming-of-age drama like few that grace our screens and touch our hearts.
A movie that should have been made some time ago!
A masterwork for contemporary American indie cinema, that's universal and grasping in the most subdued way. Divided into three chapters that examine the life of its conflicted main character, Barry Jenkins explores themes such as identity, sexuality, and romance, communicating on them with a less-is-more mentality. Jenkins takes a minimalist approach to Moonlight, and the result is a film with nary a wasted shot, and very idiosyncratic use of music. It's a fully moving experience, that also pulls off the impossible feat of feeling so grounded in realism, while also having the translucent aura of a dream. An excellent acting showcase to, especially as three different actors play the protagonist, and they all seamlessly incorporate his mannerisms into their performance. Certain to be one of the most lingering experiences you'll have at the cinema this year.
Excellent film. Well worth seeing.
'Moonlight' is a truly remarkable piece of cinema. It showcases a wide range of topics including race, drug culture, and sexual exploration in a subtle way not usually employed by "prestige pictures" and as a result feels more potent and fulfilling than anything else released this year.
Performances are rock solid all around but let's please get some awards attention on Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris immediately!
A masterpiece. The best film of 2016.
This is the first time I've ever taken the time to review a film on RT. But I had to, if only just to say this: not a bit of praise that this movie has received is exaggerated or overblown. This movie is a masterpiece.
A slow but moving story of unrequited love and loss, loneliness, suppression and isolation. It is love and hate, jealousy and weakness. Kindness from unexpected places. Still, the story on some level is less believable than it should have been despite a stellar cast.
Slow,  slow, slow and no real plot or resolution.
Easily, now, one of my favorite films.
It excels in almost every category from acting to cinematography, to overall production design. The particular subject matter, which could have easily came off as heavy-handed, is handled with care and with craft making it undoubtedly one of the more unique films in quite some time. The fault in Moonlight is in the ambition and writing: the soundtrack and the triptych presentation calls for it to be regarded as an American epic, while I didn't quite receive it as such. I think it's a great film, but not necessarily worthy of the extremely high praise it's getting.
Well done. Great depth.
Heartbreaking and poetic. Don't waste money on Madea nonsense, see this instead!
Good story and loved the relationships. I thought the mom and Juan did an amazing job with their characters. I will admit it was a bit slow and I felt the chemistry was off between grown up little and Kevin.
Powerful and moving Moonlight is a great film that gets under your skin. The movie can get a little bit of slow at times but it's just a minor gripe in an otherwise excellent film. The acting is great, the story has a lot of emotion, and the dialogue is a very well written. I don't know if I would go as far as saying it's the best movie of the year but it definitely should be an Oscar contender.
If you only watch one movie this year - make it this one.
Totally hypnotizing in terms of storyline, acting, cinematography 
Totally touched by this one
Moonlight

A young black man's story is told over three significant chapters of his life and encompasses his homosexuality, drug addicted mother and overall isolation.

Moonlight pulls back the curtain of stereotypes and exposes a story that few of us have experienced. A little film with great power that is presented with expert subtlety and worthy of multiple award nominations. 

One of my favorite films of the year. 

Grade:  A 

Big Al says see #Moonlight in the theatre.
Everything about the movie is a masterpiece.  Awesome Cinematography, acting, and story.  There truly some chilling scenes.
One of the best movies I've ever seen. It is so powerful, so intimate, so subtle, yet often heartbreaking and ultimately quietly moving. "Moonlight" is unquestionably a perfect film, a timeless coming-of-age drama that will resonate with us for generations. It is a film about acceptance, a film about love and human connection, a film about isolation and masculinity and its effect on one's identity. It's a fantastic film.
Lusciously shot and loving written, MOONLIGHT is exceptional even in its most sentimental moments. The ensemble's tender performance and Barry Jenkins' romantic direction make this difficult story a pleasure to behold. I can't wait to experience it again.
3 hours later and this film still has me captivated.
A clever structure of switching actors to follow the lead characters from childhood to adult.  An honest and vulnerable journey through growing up with an addicted parent and the examination of teenage sexual desire.
Sooooo boring :0( And the bullying scenes were violent and hard to watch :0(
A powerful, sensitive look at the "conflicted" views of the gay lifestyle within the African-American community, as told through the coming of age story of a young man in Miami. The picture's phenomenal ensemble cast (featuring many first-time performers), incisive writing and creative camera work make a potent, impactful combination that breathe life into a well-told, deftly handled story. This is an important film, one well deserving of all the accolades it has received -- and of the awards it's worthy of winning.
Must-see, definitely one of the best of the year so far.
Inspiring and definitive.
Excellent, visceral film. Possibly best film of 2016. A must see.
By fair one of the best and most important movies made in a very long time. I cannot recommend this movie enough, it is a must see. Raw, Real, Honest...Life!!
Intensely intimate look at one man's  coming of age.  It may lack the epic scope and unique production of Boyhood but it delivers a far tighter and much more emotional experience.
The new movie "Moonlight" is being praised for telling its story from the perspective of a person not often heard from in the movies, namely poor black gay youth.   While I certainly agree to this, and while this also persuaded me to see the movie in the first place, it does something else: "Moonlight," unlike any other movie I can remember seeing, underscores how societal norms of masculinity can interfere with the self-development of any boy growing up realizing he is gay.  The main character is bullied throughout his childhood and adolescence for being gay by both his friends and his family.   It leads him to a path of drugs, crime and self-hate.   He has nightmares and flashbacks throughout the film where he is reminded that because he is who he is, he will likely never enjoy the self-expression so many of us take for granted.   While he does have some role models to assist him, he withdraws from them because of his self-hate.    The reticence of the main character gives the film a poetic mood, filled with long pauses that allow you to reflect with him on his view of the world.   The movie is divided into 3 sections, and though physically not immediately recognizable from the beginning to the end, the character Chiron is familiar to any of us who have struggled with self-discovery.   The movies I would imagine it would be compared to most are "Brokeback Mountain" and "Boyhood," but to equate it solely on the subject matter does injustice to all of these great movies.   "Moonlight" is beautifully directed, with a great score and even better acting.   On the heels of the Academy being criticized for not recognizing black actors of films in recent years, it would be a real travesty to not ackowledge this excellent film.
Keeps you interested the whole way through. It's easy to get invested in
A beautiful film, and easily one of the best films of 2016. It's near perfect, and will grab you for it's smart script, beautiful cinematography, and strong performances. The film is equal parts authentic and haunting. It's an important story, and told boldly using young men from a demographic that more often than not denies their existence.
Magnificent story and greatly acted. The mind is left to imagine the ending. That's not what i want, so it felt short, the buildup was tremendous for the ultimate let down.
If you are a film buff or love movie with meaning go see #moonlight. The final lead actor is #TrevanteRhodes from Little Elm, TX and the entire film brings you inside a different zone of America that society has tend to ignore but has tried to address through out the decades. Great music score. Great black cast of actors #Blackfilms #BarryJenkins #AlecHibbert #AshtonSanders #TarellMcCaney #moonlightmovie
Terrific acting from start to finish. 
Bully "Terrel" is super scary!!
As beautiful and heartfelt as a true-to-life story can get. Told with a brilliance of style and gut-punch honesty, this film doesn't miss a beat to surprise the audience. Those who are looking for more of a gay romance sort of film will be disappointed I think. This film is much more than that. It's about growing up and trying to find where you fit within the world around you but at the same time coming to terms with who you are as a person, for good or bad. It hits on so many levels that there should be something that each member of the audience can identify with. A stunning film and it's quite easily the best of the year.
A great story. Honest. The three actors playing the lead did an amazing job.
Coming into this film I didn't know too much about it. I knew that it is a film set in different stages in a man's life, and he's trying to find himself. It seemed interesting, but once I saw the praise it was getting I had to look into it. Although I thought the whole Best Picture fiasco was horrible for the awards show, I am tremendously happy that Moonlight ended up winning Best Picture. The reason why is because it is an absolutely beautiful film. The acting is phenomenal, and I really believe that Viola should've been in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category, with Naomie Harris then winning Supporting Actress, but I digress. The cinematography and direction is stunning throughout, and the narrative as a whole is beautiful to follow. All three actors that played Chiron were tremendous, and I'm glad Mahershala Ali won an Oscar for his role. This is both an important film and a truly emotional film. This is my favorite film of 2016, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of all-time.
Beautifully restrained, subtle, but very powerful film. Naomie Harris deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance. Extremely impressed how the writer/director avoided turning this into a melodramatic and stereotypical showcase. I do wish certain elements of the film could had been more developed such as the supportive relationships that began to start between young Chiron and his caretakers and male role model. This could had propelled it to a 5 star rating. But overall, this was a fantastic film with a few classic and brilliant scenes, particularly towards the end of the movie.
Jenkins's second film may be a masterpiece, but such a heavy label threatens to upend the delicate wonders of this film, which reveals its pleasures with a quiet elegance. Its lush colors and images, vivid performances and musical score, wash over you like ocean waves gently splashing ashore. You breathe in this film. Jenkins's lyricism draws you into Chiron's story with such clarity and poetry that it becomes your story. In a year which saw the rise of hatred and ignorance, this film fills you up with love and understanding.
'Moonlight' is a gentle, tender coming-of-age story that tackles multiple issues with great care and precision.  It miraculously maintains its poignancy without ever devolving into exploitation.  And it takes its time with the story and characters, giving the audience the feeling that they've truly gotten to know them and watch them grow.
Not at all familiar with any of Barry Jenkins' work, this being his second feature length film after Medicine For Melancholy, which he made some eight years ago. But this certainly has got everyone's attention already being quite iconic of 2016/17 with that stunning, neon soak poster. I didn't notice at first, only until after watching the film did I realise it's an amalgamation of three different faces. 

Based on an unseen play by fellow Miami man, Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both men coming from the same neighbourhood with Jenkins actually filming on location, the very same area he grew up in. We follow Chiron, the film spanning his lifetime, split into three different acts going from child through teenager to a young man who is struggling with self-identity and sexuality on the rough and poverty-stricken streets of Miami. 

We witness the struggles, the inner conflict and how Chiron interacts with the often violent world around him, trying to understand friendship and peer pressure, dotted with key life-changing events that help shape the man he eventually becomes. 

I unfortunately found it hard to watch three different actors play Chiron through the ages, losing credibility for them being the same character and I think that's a result of Jenkins' decision to keep the three actors separate so not to influence one another and to encourage their own portrayals of Chiron. Though all three actors perform incredibly well, I just found it near impossible to relate them to each other, their physical appearance didn't enforce this either. Though the character of Kevin, the last two actors Jharrel Jerome and André Holland seemed to gel nicely. 

The supporting cast is strong, Mahershala Ali fast becoming a star but it was Brit Naomie Harris who is absolutely amazing playing Chiron's crack addicted mother, the only constant character throughout. Her performance is outstanding. 

The film beautiful, the technical artistry is amazing with incredible colour capture and reminds myself of how glorious Florida is to look at and experience. Theres moments of thoughtfulness, a strong mood of melancholy when coupled with Nicholas Britell's classical yet sometimes eerie and distorted score. 

Out of the oscar nominations the film has rightly received, I think it deserves to win the best adapted screenplay over Lion and Arrival, and it could snatch best picture from La La Land or Hacksaw Ridge. 

It's not going to be to everyone taste and some may find it uncomfortable to watch, putting some viewer's back out. But it comes at a perfect time of acknowledgement, a time of awareness of a once strong taboo and is going to be a film very hard to ignore.

To the extent that this movie seeks to counteract years of appropriating "black struggle" for financial gain and removing almost all stereotypes and common tropes of that genre where they might appear, this movie appears to have been a success. That should be commended, because it's a difficult thing to do. 

I question if the struggle is worth it. Is this what movies are about? Representing movies with total accuracy? Is there anything sacrificed in doing so? Am I the intended audience? I have to admit that I don't know the answers to these questions. I just know that it was a good movie - with good things and bad things. Here area few -

good: In order to be true to the community and the social realities at play whilst still communicating the conflict clearly to the audience, the movie had to use a diverse set of storytelling techniques to get us there without explicit exposition. This is essentially a love story where love is a threat. The brilliant part of this movie is that it communicates that threat and that pressure to us almost every second of the movie, but still manages to find a way to communicate the main characters attraction to and struggle with his love for the other. It's tricky, and the script pulls this off. 

bad: I'm not sure if a wide angle lens was not in the budget or what but there was an incredible lack of range with focal lengths here. While I get that this was one part stylistic, which I'm fine with, I have a sneaking suspicion that the filmmakers read a little too much critical film theory and decided that the claustrophobic effect of 90% long lens would represent faithfully the claustrophobic effect of being a poor black gay man in liberty city.  It didn't. Sometimes it was used well to get our heart rate up, close up long lens effects can give us a sense of drama because our periphery is limited, we don't know what's around the corner, we can't see what's going to jump out at them. At other times this effect was created when it had no dramatic purpose. This again, was perhaps a socio-political commentary on life in liberty city ("always on edge") but has a negative effect on the overall narrative. 

good: this move is more or less a combination of Antwon Fisher and Brokeback Mountain and succeeds in literally every way that those movies failed. It's a social commentary that doesn't necessarily sacrifice everything just to make a point. In fact, at certain points, the "point" of this movie acts as a focal point for its more frenetic aspects. 

bad: it seemed as tough every character in the movie was stronger than the main character. This is perhaps some critical theory that the film makers missed. This is because the other characters talked and moved. Our character mostly slept, looked down at shoes, ate, sat down. While a lack of dialogue can be considered a character trait, it's not. This may be necessary to make the character believable but you have to communicate character traits in other ways - mostly through action. If the character can't talk then they need to become a pantomime of multi-dimensional emotion. The endless ways in which the character brooded about told us very little, ultimately, after the first 20 minutes. Whenever this character did act or talk - it some of the best parts of the film..
loved this Movie and the cast was wonderful.
Powerful and challenging. Stays with you long after the credits roll.
Incredible performances that highlight the impact of emotional detachment / emotional sublimation on Chiron, a young man growing up in Miami, but the film also explores this with such humanity: How long can we go without true connection (parental, platonic, sexual) before we break? This movie - a movie that won BEST PICTURE for exploring the intersectionality of male blackness & queerness - answers that question on a human scale. This is not a gay black man film; it is a film about all of us. A film about human kindness. A film about love. And we need this film now more than ever.
Black cinematic beauty. Though it did go on 10 minutes too long. This is what America needs more of, a film detailing the black/minority experience.
A fantastic film that manages to focus in on a very personal, character-based narrative, while also delivering some beautiful cinematography. There are some outstanding performances here and I expected to see it getting at least a little recognition come Oscar time.
Moonlight is a wonderful story about masculinity, keeping up appearances and searching for who you truly are.
I have three words....go see it!
Outstanding acting and a film to be seen by all.
I saw 'Moonlight' today and it has stayed with me all day. Beautiful, touching and unsettling, very moving; at this point I would have to say its  my favorite movie of 2016. From the stellar acting to the visuals and soundtrack -- all I can say is "please,  Barry Jenkins, continue on this journey of making beautiful movies." I'm definitely on board.
Dont get so caught up in the forest that you cant see the trees when you view  this film
"Moonlight" | C | Well-crafted gritty, gay, coming of age story. Slow and somewhat boring. Overrated.
As the poster suggests, "Moonlight" is a neon spotlight on the life and tribulations of a...sorry, if I say anything more about who he is as a character, it will be a spoiler. I'll just say that alternate titles could have been "Gayngster" and "Brokeback Ghetto". Okay, spoiler warning. I'm not hating. It's just that I knew it was about a gay inner city kid. You watch the character of Little/Chiron/Black sponge up the influences of his personage, and, until the last minute of the movie, he never knows who he is or what he wants. Even after watching the film, I still don't quite understand who he is because most of the time he is sulking, sad, dejected, mad, or just serious - without saying much. It is a rough urban landscape he traverses, one that both nurtures him and throttles him. He imitates those around him, and prevails through tribulations. That's great, but when you are showing not telling (through dialogue or narration), the little dialogue there is should be more than just conversational. These aren't simple people - these are complex and savvy individuals with low education. I know that leaving things unsaid can create a space for deeper understanding, and it can be conveyed by attitude and actions. Often it went nowhere, as if all whispers of character development were simply in service of the climax of each act. The characters (with the exception of Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monáe) only engage each other at the surface level and only tell each other (and the audience) their plain motivations. I was waiting the whole movie for a moment when a greater theme comes through or when something greater than the characters occurs. Sadly, somewhat simplistically, we just learn that being black and gay is difficult because of poverty, conceptions of masculinity, and drugs. I know, I know, it wasn't made for me, but it was made for me to see another perspective. In that aspect, "Moonlight" succeeds, and I know it is story that needs to be told. I guess I was just hoping for something a little more universally resonant and less silent and pensive.
Wow, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
La dura vita di un ragazzo di periferia viene raccontata in modo esemplare in questo potente film, ricco di emozione e profondità. Barry Jenkins stupisce tutti con una regia eccezionale, ricca di inquadrature ben pensate e grande attenzione al particolare. I tre periodi raccontati sfociano in una fine che lascia un grande bagaglio emotivo e tantissimi spunti su cui riflettere. Senza dubbio tra i migliori dell'anno.
There are very few films that have the impact that this film has. The writing, cast, and score create a space to empathize. To no only feel the struggle that so many of us live, but to find ourselves, wherever we can, in it as well. Chiron is someone bigger than himself.
Great script and very well acted.   One of the best films of the year.    The main character is so sad.
Moonlight is a very important and well made film. The performances were top notch. The three actors who played Chiron were really good. Mahershala Ali was great in his role. While he isn't in it a lot, he does stand out. My favorite performance in this film goes to Naomie Harris. She shines in every scene she's in. The film deals with very important themes, like bullying, addiction, and sexuality. I liked the way the film handles these themes. Barry Jenkins directs this film in a very unique way. He sets up some beautiful shots in this film. I think the film was better in its first two acts than its third. While the third act was good, it didn't succeed as much as the other two acts did. Overall, this isn't the perfect film critics are making this out to be. Still, it is beautifully shot and features excellent performances and important themes.
An epic film, full of everything you'd want and everything you'd want (but didn't know it), Moonlight is a movie dedicated to keeping what is so beautiful about cinema alive--the power of a simple yet emotional and enthralling story.
Last night I had the privilege of seeing "Moonlight" in the Arclight Dome. It's an understated beauty of a film with complex characters, just enough dialogue, and incredible acting. The pacing pulls you along through the inner torment of a boy/teenager/young man, trying to survive a rough life in Miami's projects. I was expecting more of a gut wrenching film, but the points of incredible tenderness were more like getting a steaming mug of hot chocolate after coming in from winter storm. It did feel a little bit long, but then again, I'm usually seeing more action-oriented films, so my brain has to be told to slow down and appreciate things, to take it all in.
"Amazingly well-acted and well-photographed, "Moonlight" shines as one of the best movies of 2016. It never strikes a wrong note."
Movie Review: Moonlight
Date Viewed: January 24 2017
Directed By Barry Jenkins
Screenplay By Barry Jenkins, Story By Tarell Alvin McCraney, Based on the play "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue" by Tarell Alvin McCraney
Starring: Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders, Alex Hibbert, Jharrel Jerome, Andre Holland, Jaden Piner, Patrick Decile, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Janelle Monae.

This beautiful and essential movie feels like the work of a great poet. "Moonlight" is a breathlessly stunning achievement from director Barry Jenkins and it also feels socially relevant due to dark times in America right now. "Moonlight" centers around a shy and quietly withdrawn child named Chiron whose story is told in three compelling chapters, i. Little (Childhood), ii. Chiron (Teenhood) and iii. Black (Adulthood).

Amazingly well-acted and well-photographed by cinematographer James Laxton, "Moonlight" shines as one of the best movies of 2016. It never strikes a wrong note. In the first episode "Little", Chiron (Alex Hibbert) is a shy and quietly withdrawn child who gets picked on by a group of bullies and he runs and hides in an empty house. Chiron is later found by a crack dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who takes him into his home where he scores an unlikely friendship with him. Chiron starts to open up and reveals that he has no father to raise him and he lives with her abusive and crack addict mother, Paula (Naomie Harris).

Chiron turns to Juan and his live-in girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monae) more as his father/and mother figures and he spends more time with him and he also finds a friend named Kevin (Jaden Piner) who he grows more attached to. In the second chapter "Chiron", we see a teenaged Chiron (Ashton Sanders) who continues to be a close friend of Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) but he gets severely bullied daily by his fellow peer and student, Terrel (Patrick Decile). Even though Juan is now deceased, it doesn't stop Chiron from continuing to visit Teresa and he still often spends nights at her house because her mother is still a crack-addicted mess.

Continuing to be the target of Terrel's relentless bullying, a social worker pressures Chiron to either suspend them or pressing any charges but he doesn't believe any of that is going to stop the bullying so he takes matters into his own hands by smashing a chair into Terrel's back which gets him arrested. Chiron's relationship with Kevin also turns estranged because he and Terrel partook in beating him up in the school yard.

In the third chapter "Black", Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is now a hardened adult and drug dealer who lives outside Atlanta and he now goes by the name Black. One night, he gets a phone call from Kevin (Andre Holland) who works as a server and cook at a diner and he asks Chiron to come and visit him in Miami. Kevin also apologizes to Chiron for his unthinkable actions in the school yard which drove Chiron to revenge and hit Terrel in the back. Chiron first comes to a drug treatment facility where his drug-addict mother now resides. Chiron despises her previous behavior with him but their tense conversation comes to a pleasing conclusion when he tearfully forgives her.

Chiron finally comes to Miami to visit Kevin and he admits that he's never been in relationship with another person. Kevin was the only person Chiron ever thought about because he's intimately gay. All three actors (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes) who play Chiron in three different time periods are terrific in habiting this one role and familiar supporting actors Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris give extraordinary, Oscar-worthy performances as the crack dealer who cares for little Chiron and the crack-addict mother who ignores and mostly abuses Chiron.

"Moonlight" reminded me a lot of "Boyhood" because it tells another slice-of-life story in America and it's told in three separate dramatic stages. Writer and director Barry Jenkins (Medicine for Melancholy) who adapts from Tarell Alvin McCraney's critically acclaimed play "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue" doesn't hold anything back or make a false move. He tackles the difficulties of dealing with loneliness and cultural sexually in a way that's universal and remarkably authentic.

Deeply moving, sad, brilliant and great all around, I cannot recommend it any higher.
Moonlight  is a well crafted drama about a relevant and important subject, the director Barry Jenkins manages to keep emotion in the right place with a strong ensemble cast, impeccable production and an narrative that don't have fear to show how society most of the time fails to deal with serious issues like bullying and sexual orientation. (4,5/5)
It was heavy but good.  Would not be surprised if a best actor or supporting actor nomination came from the Oscar Academy.  Story was a little slow and the ending was a little disappointing.  Overall I enjoyed it.
Moonlight asks the audience for their patience, and its subtle quiet examination of a black gay male's life pays off in ways you won't expect; one of the year's rare feats in cinema
Masterfully directed and acted, Moonlight tells a poignant coming of age story, of a person who grows up in a very harsh environment, that beautifully and intimately highlights the moments, the people and the decisions that shape a person.
Not the cinematic orgasm it's hyped as, but good flick.
Although Barry Jenkins' film is indeed about the struggles and difficulties of a person embracing his culturally reviled sexuality, the story is universal in scope and intent.
A masterpiece. Beautiful, wonderful, heartbreaking, touching...all the words. Reminded me of why I love the movies.
Powerfully acted by all 3 of the leads who play Chiron (the main character) as well as outstanding performances by Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris, Moonlight is the story of a gay African American boy growing up around Miami with a drug dealer father figure and a drug addict mother. We watch as Chiron goes through 3 key points in his life: a kid growing up and learning what it even means to be gay, a teenager who learns the harsh truths about how society and culture can treat members of the LGBTQ community and lastly as him as an adult finally confronting his homosexuality. From a technical standpoint this movie is brilliant as the cinematography, score, screenplay, and direction are all spot on as well as all of the performances. The story is fantastic although my major gripe with the film is the ending as it just sort of ends with no real conclusion. Chiron finally confronts his demons, theres a scene of catharsis and then it ends...No real climax or resolution. As a piece of film and based on a true life experience the film is fantastic and portrays it's characters beautifully and hauntingly. Overall the film is definitely one of 2016s best with my only gripe being an unfinished ending. That being said I can't argue it's best picture win tonight at the Oscars even after the screw up with the best picture award. Definitely worth seeing though. 4.5/5
Absolutely loved this movie. Its not easy to watch but the performances are superb.Some Oscar nods for sure.
This film is close to perfet. We are immersed in a heartbreaking journey of the main character as he tries to face his true identity while dealing with his culture, mother and social pressures. The acting and cinematography are top notch. It's a story that needs to be told, and it is told in the least preachy way possible. It uses silence, at times, to create the most powerful emotions.
Moonlight is a powerful (I wanted to avoid saying that word, but I can't) and sensitively-made work of art that highlights the day to day existence of a young, intersectional man coming of age. The acting is stellar across the board, the script and camera work have a naturalistic (but occasionally heightened) feel, while the gorgeous lighting (a strange thing to praise, I know) makes the movie's themes feel...immersive. In many ways, I think Moonlight is an effective counterpart to Brokeback Mountain - one of my favorite films ever made - for the modern age.
THE BEST FILM OF 2016! A coming-of-age piece that tells its main character's compelling life-story with three defining chapters of his life, and does so with spellbinding passion.
Magnificent filmmaking!
honest. graceful. beautiful.
Barry Jenkins deftly crafts a look inside the soul of a man through three chapters.  One os an adolescent, the next as a teen, and finally as a young adult.  The acting is encompassing and the central character is layered and portrayed wonderfully.  We're left wondering about a couple things which is the only aspect that keeps this from perfect, but it's a flaw that drags us down to a 7.8 of 10.
An incredibly touching film. The central character's vulnerability is palpable throughout. Schmalt free.
The best 2016 has to offer. It's tough to watch but shows aspects of life a lot of people don't get to see.
Extremely slow. Overrated. Long. Ponderous. Gloomy throughout. Devoid of humor. Soap opera speed. Don't believe the description of the "plot." There is no real love affair, and not much struggle with anyone's sexuality. Nor is it "heartbreaking." Any critic who dares call this a Brokeback Mountain is out of his or her mind.  The worst part was the casting. The three actors playing the same character could not possibly have looked any more different than one another. And the casting of another character who appears later is equally as inexplicable. I find it hard to believe that they could not find three actors that looked a bit alike. Worst casting I've seen in a very long time. I couldn't get past it, and I almost walked out, if not for the good acting from the leads. Plus I was in a premiere screening and didn't feel I should just walk out in front of people who might have been enjoying it. 

There is no significant story or dialogue to hold my interest. And I didn't care for the characters. The shocking casting problem jarred me so much that I absolutely could not feel the slightest continuity of the main character. Thus, I couldn't care less about him and his supposed decades-long journey. I really wanted to love this, and I kept an open mind. But the whole thing fizzled out for me. W

We've seen this all before on TV, soaps, and film. There was not a single new thing about this story. Married gay character. Bullying in high school by closeted gay lover. Totally cliché and worn out story lines. Beware of the hype.
Moonlight is one of those films that anytime your mind tends to float back to it inevitable feelings of great sympathy and understanding come with it. It is a film that both simply and oh so complexly transcends all barriers of politics and beliefs and presents a bare bones human story that just so happens to deal with being black and being gay. It's always been clear, especially from the outside looking in, that the culture that forms young black men is one of the toughest, most high-pressure environments for one to be tough, hard, or essentially show little to no feeling at all. "Toxic masculinity" as it has been labeled in recent writings. There has long existed the stigma that to be hard or worthy of being a man one must be largely indifferent to those things that naturally give us weaknesses in the world. By tackling this idea and how it affects the growth and development of one underprivileged youth is at one time to present exactly what it promises while at another-painting a much broader picture of this toxicity that has been constructed by society for which many young men are led to believe there are certain actions that have to be taken or certain attitudes that must be adopted in order to make them worthy of being a man. This doesn't have to necessarily deal with sexuality, but more this condition is about those stereotypes of men-emotionless, dominant, violent-that society has relayed to determine certain levels of masculinity. That Moonlight addresses such expectations and the baggage, the torture, the living hell such expectations can carry when not met in the judgmental environments of the projects or of high school or even of one's mother who knows the essence of her son, but isn't strong enough herself to stand up to such stigma's thus leaving that child for the wolves of the world is powerful enough. That Moonlight is able to explore these largely ignored aspects of manhood in such poetic and provocative ways as through the lens of a young man growing up black, poor, and gay only makes these points that much more enlightening and subsequently-that much more powerful. Moonlight is a film that, anytime you think about, are reminded of, or even consider the ground it covers and the essence of what it embodies not only in its ideas and themes, but in its nearly flawless execution inevitable feelings of great sympathy and understanding come as well. More than anything, writer/director Barry Jenkins understands the human element at the core of these issues and by parlaying as much through the single perspective of Chiron at three different stages of his life we are delivered a fleshed out portrait of the true internal tendencies versus the ideals we're taught we should become.

A truly personal and engrossing film that quietly has a lot to say about race, sexuality and family.  All of the characters are both subtle and multi-dimensional. My only small criticism, broken into three chapters, there is a touch of inconsistency from story to story. but still one of the top ten films of the year.
Beautiful cinematography. Moving story.
Most years, the Academy gets it wrong.  This is a perfect example of that fact.  While "Moonlight" is certainly a deep and moving story, it was not the best film of 2016.  I missed it while in theatres due to its limited run in my area, and based on the critical reviews, I was upset.  However, after catching it on Amazon Prime, I now feel it was $20 well saved.  That's not to say it's a bad film.  In fact, quite the opposite.  It's just not Oscar worthy...
Moonlight is directed and written by Barry Jenkins, and it stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali in a coming-of-age drama about the three stages of life from Chiron which are from the time when he was a little kid, teenager, and adult in terms of his sexual identity and what he has to deal with. For my third film in the Academy Awards approach, I decide to watch this next because when I first heard of this, I didn't take notice to it without even knowing what it's about, and when it starts getting high positive reviews which ended up getting Best Picture from Academy Awards, got me very curious about it and decide to rent it. Turns out, I understand why it got Best Picture as it rightfully deserves it. The three actors that played Chiron which are Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes are superb in this as they both give their different versions of the character, but still manage to have the same spirit of the same character, which makes it interesting to know that the director didn't want any of the actors for Chiron to meet each other after filming is done so that they don't imitate each other. Naomie Harris did a fantastic job being a drug addict that doesn't appreciate his son that I'm glad to see her get some recognition, even Mahershala Ali who was not in it that much, but still left an impact on the film that I'm glad that he won an Oscar for it. The three stories of Chiron's life are equally so investing to watch of how this kid is going through his sexual identity when he doesn't know how to deal with it, which her mother doesn't help with the situation, and is very well-written by Barry Jenkins. The cinematography by James Laxton is well done that the shots have purpose of the scenes that it's showing. The score by Nicholas Britell is beautiful with the violin scenes, and when there's is an actual song, it fits with the scene, and it doesn't feel like it's a way to get a paycheck out of it. I didn't really know where it's leading, especially when it gets to the next story, and the way it's portrayed in this in terms of coming-of-age films, it's quite special and very refreshing in its way that does it a bit similarly to Boyhood, but puts the character in a horrible situation in the slums. There are great moments that are just satisfying to watch multiple times, and the diner scene is really heartfelt and natural that you felt like you were there with him after all the things that he had to go through. Moonlight is a masterpiece that I'm glad I got to notice Barry Jenkins as a director/writer and can't wait to see him do his next film that's about The Underground Railroad.
Great imagery, some unnecessary drawn out scenes, very thin on plot, does fit the zeitgeist of our time.
This I must say was very excellent. I liked it very much indeed. Naomi Harris played an excellent role in this movie. This should be nominated for some major awards in the Oscars. It's definitely a must see! You don't want to miss this! It's a work of art!
The filmmaking moves with elegance and grace, to tell a story that is rarely told in cinema and through a perspective that shines brighter than the title itself.

Best Gay Movie since Weekend. The acting was top notch. How they capture the feelings of the main character will make you share his. It's a most see
This tale of a young man and his journey of self discovery which spans three parts of his life is a well crafted film. Very often a film can be described as a "must see" or "film of the year" and after seeing this it can be given both labels. Some parts of what the character goes through a few of us can identify with as he travels to adulthood.  

If you're looking for a film with heart, empathy and will run you through a gamut of emotions then spend your time in his world. I wasn't disappointed and I doubt that you will be either.
totally not the best picture this year
I was a little skeptical of the format of "different stages of life," especially since no one can top "Boyhood." But it's not gimmicky and it's not the selling point. It's just a genuine part of the story and more importantly applies well to the setting in this film. The script is nearly flawless and the central three performances of the main character elevate it into exceptional territory. Also, we need more films about diversity like this.
The best film of 2016
Moonlight is perhaps the best film i've seen all year. All of the performances, the cinematography, and Barry Jenkins' writing and directing are all excellent. Moonlight never feels repetitive nor boring. It's an exceptionally executed story of a man dealing with the struggles of his everyday life and we see the unfold beautifully. I recommend Moonlight to everyone.
Film language is used as a canvas for one of the most poetic and expressionistic takes on male identity and human relations in recent memory. Jenkins' aesthetic sensibilities and James Laxton's lyrical cinematography create an atmosphere of intimacy that dwell in the landmark experiences in Chiron's life.

This stylistic approach reminiscent of Christopher Doyle's Wong Kar-Wai collaborations is let loose during the first two chapters, while we as spectators are engaged viscerally as the character develops in front of our eyes. In the final chapter, the aesthetic subversion is dialed down a knot, but just because the restraint is then used to emphasise the powerful nature of the situations, elevated by the resonance of what we've seen the character go through so far. This closure is so effective it actually gives new context to the rest of the film, stunning with a circular reflexion as beautiful as it is devastating.

In a Criterion segment, Jenkins raved about Wong's ability to take interiority and translating it to the screen. Well, this might not reach the perfection of In The Mood For Love, but what a way to pay homage to his cinematic hero.
A transcendent experience, not only visually, but emotionally.
Very Wong Kar-wai alike
A serious contender for best movie of 2016. Filled with great performances and haunting scenes, it's a must see.
fantastic I've seen it twice and have room for a third.
5 Stars. An absolute masterpiece. You won't find a more intimate, sad, beautiful, or emotive film than this one.
This is a near perfect film. Incredibly moving, from the acting to the brilliant direction and that beautiful music. It all worked so well together and the pain in the characters eyes throughout the film was heartbreaking to say the least. Do not miss this film. Even if your a piece of crap homophobe. It will move you to tears and will teach you a valuable life lesson
A moving coming of age story that takes you through three stages of growing up.  A heartwarming story of bullying, coming out, drugs, and love.  I sparingly rate movies with 5 stars but this well written and acted drama deserves every single one.
Beautiful storyline...Beautiful cast...BEAUTIFUL!!!
Midnight reveals in magnificently subtle shades and gestures the heartbreaks, betrayals, and hard-won victories of a gay African American boy gowing to manhood in the segregated, homophobic  21st century. Scenes develop in a heady cocktail of color, light, heat, love, as well as dialogue redolent with many kinds of love, shame, fear, loneliness, and desire. Midnight's not a fantasy or an escape. It chronicles brutal truths about finding yourself in against the odds. But the film is undeniably beautiful.
Excellent film. Great music, writing, acting and especially directing. I love movies that take their time and let the story breath and allow silence to carry weight. Too much and it can be boring of course, but this movie tells a simple story and wow is it done well. I really respect the work that went into this movie.
This is it! The best movie of 2016. Period!
This gets to a point where the story just absorbs you and you can't let go and don't want it to end. The only negative to this movie is that I wish it was longer as the three chapters it was divided in to felt like they needed more fulfilment to accomplish. Nevertheless the time it had, it spent it well and as best as it could. Most characters were phenomenal in their roles, but the three who played the main character were the most grattifying. I will remember this tale for a while to come.
A powerful film! Moonlight is a coming-of-age story with brilliant acting, superb storytelling, and a look that sums up the film--tragically beautiful. A must see for any fan of character pieces, and 2014's Boyhood.
Writer/director Barry Jenkins' boldly and uniquely told a film about a human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place and his own sexuality in the world while growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami is both heartbreaking and deeply. Moonlight is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America
Watched this phenomenal film tonight at the Roxie. It has everything. Interesting well acted characters, nuanced story telling. I laughed and cried. I was so enthralled, best movie i have seen in the theatres in the last six years. Will be going back tomorrow
Truly powerful movie!!
A staggeringly perfect film with rich camerawork and nuanced performances.
Absolutely amazing and completely breathtaking, when it ended I was craving more!
Moonlight deserves the Best Picture Academy Award
Bravo Barry Jenkins , Holland, Harris & Ali...A truly an Oscar performance movie..You guys well deserve more oscars for the team performance..I saw it 3 times and I cannot get enough...words are not enough..A MUST SEE...TRULY A MUST SEE....BRAVO
The hype is well deserved. The acting is masterful, the cinematography powerful. Great writing too.
One of the greatest films you will ever see. A powerhouse, cinematic masterpiece.
Best film of the year.
Moonlight is a 2016 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Barry Jenkins. 
I found the first half of this drama to be quite slow-paced and with very minimal plot points. The story does pick up in the second half. While the film does have a good and interesting basic story, there is just not enough substance to make this a classic. The film contains some interesting camera angles and filming techniques which mostly enhance but occasionally subtract from the total. I found three scenes to be quite emotional and unexpectedly brought tears to my eyes. The final scenes are nicely paced and enhance the anticipation for possibilities and what may come. I was initially disappointed with the sudden ending, but on reflection, it couldn't have been any other way. D & MC. 
AAW GGWD AFI 1001
Possibly the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life
From a technical standpoint, "Moonlight" is a very well made film that looks very good and put together well. I think the movie has a lot to say and is very thought provoking. The performances are all very good and the movie is definitely grounded in reality. The film is told in three parts and each part is compelling in its own way. That being said, I do feel that there were better movies in 2016. It's far from the best picture of the year in my eyes, but that doesn't mean it's a movie to miss. I think it is a well directed, written, and acted movie that has a lot to say about society and what masculinity is. There isn't a whole lot going on in the runtime of this movie, but it definitely is one that will make you think and it is very unique in its style and storytelling.
I liked this movie. The writing, the acting, and the explored themes make quite the impact. My only gripe was that it was a bit dry for me. Very interesting character study.
A very strange movie that somehow became a best picture and I honestly don't know why...
Such an overwhelmingly beautifully sad film. So worth the viewing experience if you can catch it in theaters.
Moonlight is atypical in the best way possible. The movie's flow is magic! A-
Sumptuous, layered, beautiful.
Best human story ever told
Great movie, very moving .... loved it
A coming of age tale told in a different light. With a breakout performance by Ali.
Didn't really like it
A honest, yet brutal and masterfully engaging movie about not just about being black, gay or anything of the sort instead a movie about nature vs nurture and discovery of ones self. A rare film indeed that will no doubt force the Oscars Hand for at least giving this a best picture nomination 

"A-"
very emotional, and fresh perspective not seen in mainstream film
Every once in a while, a movie comes at a time where it's utterly timeless but the circumstances of current events make it all the more timely. Moonlight is one of those movies, and in a time in history where hate seems to be the defining trait of humans in the world, it's affirming to see such an empathetic and understated character study. Even as a white asexual man, this movie is intimate in how it deconstructs the ways in which traditional masculinity can easily be forced upon others as a societal prison that people passively put themselves into just for the sake of societal norms and false comfort. Told in three parts, Moonlight chronicles the life of Chiron as a small child (Alex Hibbert), a teenager (Ashton Sanders), and a grown man (Trevante Rhodes). He lives in a rough neighborhood in Miami with his mother Paula (Naomie Harris, Skyfall), a nurse and drug addict. A timid and quiet boy, Chiron forges a relationship with local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monáe), and the film follows Chiron's growth from boy to man as he deals not only with realizing that he's gay as he develops a romantic attraction towards peer Kevin, but also being black and gay. The movie is thoroughly understated, working fully to its advantage about nine out of ten times. Writer/director Barry Jenkins frames the film solely on Chiron, giving the audience a chance to quickly observe and understand his surroundings. Jenkins finds unique and engaging ways to shoot each scene. Intimate interactions often place the audience right into the center of the unfolding events by using POV shots, whether it's between mother and son, a bully and Chiron in the street, or Chiron and Kevin's romantic moments. It's a simple but effective tool that not a lot of filmmakers use to this degree of success. Similarly, the film has a very interesting look to it, often times employing a shallow depth of field. As the camera tracks Chiron across the streets or through the hallways at school, the human element of it all feels heightened and the rest feels slightly dreamlike. The orchestral score from Nicholas Britell also makes emotions feel heightened. All the while, Jenkins's script provides for insight into the character without every coming off as obvious or heavy-handed. As mentioned earlier, the film is, at its core, about traditional masculinity and what it does to people. We see boys playing aggressively and bullying those that are weaker or quieter; we watch teenagers objectify women and brag about their sexual exploits when in the presence of other males. We also see how some of these same people act in private or with those on the same wavelength. The script doesn't waste time on peripheral characters--if a character speaks to our protagonist or has an interaction with him, it casts some sort of a shadow on the behavior of his that follows. It's when we see Chiron as a man, wearing an armor in the form of muscle and putting grills in his teeth that we see how boxed in he has become. All of the performances are fantastic, and the child performances on display here aren't just good for a child; they're good performances overall. Mahershala Ali lends a great sense of sympathy and warmth to his character and cements how impactful this man is to Chiron as a child. Naomie Harris is almost unrecognizable at some points; the ways that she quivers, cries, and even speaks at times are deeply emotional. I'd be really happy if she were to get a nomination for Best Supporting Actress; she never resorts to exploiting her character's issues or chewing the scenery for the sake of emotional effect. My one issue with Moonlight is that it sometimes feels slightly inconsistent in terms of its emotional weight. That isn't to say that there are times when it fails, but instead there are simply times where it succeeds a little less than other times. The introduction to the character of Kevin could have been a little bit longer and the ending left me a little bit cold but grew on me as soon as I left the theater. Nevertheless, these are very small issues, and the beauty of emotion of Moonlight--my eyes welled up at least five times--definitely makes it one of the best movies of the year. 9.2/10, amazing, A, far above average, etc.
To me a great film is measured by its smaller moments, and how it's able to extend itself to the bigger picture of the movie. and Moonlight is that kind of film that gets it.
Played as a 3 act film (literally), the film follows Chiron as young boy, teenager and adult along with the battles he faces with his sexuality. One thing I love about Chiron's character is the consistent ticks (him occasionally spacing out, and his head down in serious conversations) that are revisited during every act. That helps the viewer be reminded of where he came from even when he makes a drastic physical change. The supporting characters all have great performances, particularly Mahershala Ali as Juan. Even with his smaller role, he leaves a strong impact as a neighborhood drug dealer that Chiron changes his perspective in a powerful way.

Moonlight is a film I could talk about for hours about what I love about its exploration about a black males identity, which brings it all home with a beautifully directed final scene. Before I get any more long winded, I'll say this.....Moonlight shines it's way into being my favorite film so far this year and deserves your attention.
Easily one of the year's best and most surprising films, this engrossing coming-of-age/coming out drama traces the personal journey of Chiron, the gentle, soft-spoken son of a crack-addicted single mother in Miami.  Played beautifully by three different actors during various periods of his life, we watch this desperately lonely adolescent shoulder his many burdens almost entirely on his own, reluctantly transforming into the only role society seems willing to offer him, that of an innercity drug dealer.  It may sound like a depressing way to spend a couple of hours, but MOONLIGHT defies expectations at every turn.  Like Chiron himself, this quietly devastating film finds hope in unexpected places.  More importantly, it challenges our preconceived notions about masculinity and reminds us to look for the beauty in even the bleakest situations.  Trust me, you'll be hearing plenty about this movie come Oscar time, so why not get ahead of the crowd?  Seriously, this is a MUST-SEE.
The greatest impending social fear within joining a group, community or society is the very expectation that comes with it and the daunting fear of having a true identity that is a contradiction to the status quo. Nature seeks to isolate and destroy the anomaly, forcing individuals who are different within any social enclave to augment their identity to camouflage themselves and to survive the day-to-day inner-workings of the imposed expectations. Many black Americans feel this way within American society, and yet for many gay black Americans, they feel even more cast aside.

Rejected by a white society searching for homogeneity, and debased by a poverty-stricken black social enclave demanding masculinity and cultural conformity, the identity of a gay black male is seemingly constricted to victimization. Within the media, the representation of gay black males is often constrained to the humorous stereotype, or the shamefully self-serving closeted cheater. The expectations, labels and ideas placed upon black people and furthermore black gay males is so layered and multi-faceted with demeaning limitations that it's a suffocating experience of which there seems to be no true escape. This is ultimately why filmmaker Barry Jenkins' sophomore film Moonlight is so liberating.

Based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, Barry Jenkins' feature film Moonlight follows Chiron, a young African-American male living in Miami, Florida (and later Atlanta, Georgia) during the height of the war on drugs in Reagan's America. Using a three chapter bipartite structure, the film explores Chiron at three important periods in his young life and marking each chapter with a transition point with Chiron evolving from a puny, persecuted little boy into a sheepish, repressed teenager and finally into a hardened drug dealer.

The first noticeable aspect of Moonlight is the craft by which it is made. From the swirling camera shifts to the distinctive color grade, James Laxton's cinematography emphasizes movement as much as it does color. Nicholas Britell's score, while minimalist, creates character motifs that are revisited throughout the film's progression. Such a craft is more reminiscent of Harmony Korine or Nicolas Winding Refn's stylistic predilections, and yet is used with more significance to its own haunting beauty than anything either filmmaker has attempted. Creating a unique presentation for the film, Barry Jenkins poses the possibility for black voices and expression in cinema that is both introspective and yet forward-thinking. In doing so, Moonlight eschews the cinema of pity-partying, proselytizing and enraged polemics on issues of race in favor of being as much of an affirmation of black audiences as it is a challenge to them.


The style of the film largely underscores its substance on a number of levels. While obviously a gay-related story, Moonlight operates on far too many levels to be pigeonholed to that label or cinematic subgenre in the way Pariah could be. Moonlight first encapsulates the experience of black poverty by documenting the impacted lives of those who suffered from drug abuse, the fallout of the drug trade and the decades of harsh draconian lawmaking to "prevent" it. The vicious cycles are portrayed here with exacting clarity. Similar to Justin Tipping's 2016 drama film Kicks, Moonlight examines the culture of masculinity as manifested among black men. Its examination isn't biting, yet shows the many cracks within its fabric. Jenkins, in adapting McCraney's voice, also frames the gay experience as experienced by black men in a tasteful manner far removed from tawdry sexual objectification and explanation-giving psychoanalysis. All of these social frames are depicted by the contrast of contradiction between social expectation and individualistic identity. Within those contradictions is the immense detail of humanity often missing from filmmaking and storytelling on similar subjects.

These said contradictions are found throughout Chiron's relationships. First seen attempting to escape the bullying of his peers, he takes solace in the company of Juan (portrayed by an affecting Mashershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (played beautifully by a motherly Janelle Monáe). Juan, a drug dealer with a heart, presents the contradiction of being the most empathetic to Chiron and sympathetic in his own right despite his world-destroying profession. This contradiction comes full circle with the introduction of Chiron's mother (excellently portrayed by Naomie Harris) who is a verbally abusive and neglectful crack-cocaine addict enabled by Juan's drug dealing. Completing the full circle of the crux of Chiron's development is Kevin, a childhood friend and boasting sexual provocateur with whom Chiron's limited expression of sexuality grows.

Within the embodiment of these characters, Jenkins infuses a full-fledged humanity often denied to such characters who would only be judged by the end result of their lives. Instead, the audience is shown life in a far more comprehensive manner and even in the absence of certain characters as well as the full arc of their stories, so much is still understood just by simple intuition, words and gestures. Being shown these complex experiences, Moonlight establishes that a person's sum total is made up of difficult, sometimes harsh moving parts complete with trauma, unfortunate circumstance and poor decision-making, all of which gets lost in the heat of judgment.

In using style, substance and the complexity of more realistic characterizations, Moonlight provides a very rare experience in watching a film about African-Americans. Very rarely can I point to faces in cinema and utter, "I've seen that person before." Seldom can I say, "I experienced that exact situation" with the ability to pinpoint the exact feelings I felt during that situation not to mention being able to feel them all over again in the vessel of Chiron. The encapsulated experience of black America in cinema can feel so specific to harsh situations that filmmakers are rarely able to fully transport the audience into the experience. Barry Jenkins in the most stunning fashion presents Chiron's experience in a way that it feels like my own experience, making every word, gesture and event analogous to my own. In doing so, Moonlight runs the possibility of making us all see people beyond the surfaces that they present in order to survive in a harsh environment rife with impossible expectations.

Ultimately, Moonlight is a unique experience and cinematic event that ought be remembered, emulated and expanded upon. It poses ideas, challenges and questions without pushing the answers. It seeks not to create rage against the other, but introspection of the self as a way of creating new starting points. And most poignantly, it unabashedly shows the beauty of blackness, and all without having to denigrate anyone with a lighter shade. It's unfortunate that black cinema did not reach this point earlier, but if anyone is listening or watching, it's the greatest starting point for an entirely new and badly needed frontier.
The best film of 2016. The best performances of 2016. The best script of 2016. The best cinematography of 2016. The best final twenty minutes of any film this decade. "Moonlight" is one of the most magical and wholly inspired films I've ever had the chance to experience.
Beautiful, exquisite film about the nuances of black masculinity, queerness, and addiction. Each performance is so captivating and realized that you're not sure where any of these actors' experiences end and where the characters' begin. The best movie of 2016.
A tender, heartbreaking fever dream that could not have come out in a more timely manner.
Phenomenal film. Brutal, honest, and caring.  Definitely in the mix for Oscar season
Beautiful, raw, powerful, emotional, and original; in a year filled with lackluster films, "Moonlight" stands out as a true jem and one of 2016's best.
Great movie about growing up black and gay in a low income neighboorhood. less sad than i expected but very compelling.
Haunting and beautiful, told with skillful visual storytelling, and wonderfully layered, subtle performances.
A well-crafted and poetic film with overall great performances from the entire cast. This is the kind of film that we hardly see in the theaters. The cinematography for this film is one of the best in years.
Moonlight has me numb on how African American society treats African Americans who are homosexuals, especially the said African American family's, shaming them into thinking who they love is wrong... - Moonlight is a must see with a social commentary that doesn't beat you over the head.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwqiBzDMWck
A very good movie to watch
