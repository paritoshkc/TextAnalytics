American Sniper,Oscar,"As the movie year rushes to redeem itself, it's a kick to see director Clint Eastwood back on his game.","One of the most beautiful and moving films I've ever seen. Chris Kyle is an all American hero and one of the greatest men who ever lived. In a way it is a representation of a perfect America, an America in which children grow up fearing god, respecting their parents, learning to shoot and loving their country enough to lay down their lives to protect it, it is an America we sadly see being stripped away today."
,,Clint Eastwood turns his laser-like focus toward a real-life war hero named Chris Kyle—and the price he paid to become one.,"It's a perfect balance, a sandwich. The meaty action is show in a way you can always see what is happening, something unusual and refreshing in modern films. Although it's a true story, so you might think easy to tell, it takes an artist to tell it in a way that you are by his side throughout the film. It's not made to be over the top, blow your mind entertainment, it's much deeper. It sets out to share the life of a very unique man in a thoroughly entertaining way . The rest of the sandwich, his life before and after are what make this more than just another war film. It really is genius, the really special piece being how you expect him to crack up and never be a good husband or dad again and..... Maybe watch the film."
,,"Powered by Clint Eastwood's sure-handed direction and a gripping central performance from Bradley Cooper, American Sniper delivers a tense, vivid tribute to its real-life subject.","I enjoy watching war movies, especially the ones baaed on true stories. This particular film is directed by one of my favorite actors and durectors: Clint Eastwood. He dies an excellent job putting us in the film with an outstanding and commendable war veteran suffering with the common disorder, PTSD. The detailed events displayed after Chris Kyle returns home abd the effects his behavior has on his family is outstanding. I don't think another director could have ""grabbed"" us better with the gripping details of his tour and his life."
,,"Clint Eastwood directs this fact-based story adapted from Chris Kyle's own memoir, and he gives it his usual strong touch -- uncluttered, confident, and without showing off.","The best movie by far on war and it's after math.Bradley Cooper is beyond words and very well expresses the real fight of a sniper even at war and his psyche after it.The constant war not only outside,but within him too is a challenging part to bring out to the audience.But Cooper delivers beyond acting. he story of Chris Kyle,the legendary American sniper as told in the book by the same name,is the perfect war movie without any drama and real life depiction.Clint Eastwood has once again brought out the best from his team.must watch."
,,"Clint Eastwood startlingly grips the audience with his sense of hypnotic silence, which carries suggestions of what might be termed politically apolitical pragmatism","While there's a war story here (snd the pros and cons of war on either side of the aisle are addressed, nodded to) Eastwood focuses instead on the slow pervasive addiction of warfare, how nothing compares to the adrenaline rush and how subtly it begins to creep under one's skin. Cooper solidly portrays a dude who's got it all under control, until he realizes that he doesn't. Good film."
,,"A taut, vivid and sad account of the brief life of the most accomplished marksman in American military annals, American Sniper feels very much like a companion piece—in subject, theme and quality—to The Hurt Locker.",considering the calibre of other war films out there it wasnt very good. even just looking at clint eastwoods directorial catalogue the two about iwo jima were better.
,,"Another war biopic opening on Christmas day, with tight, two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood, and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper.",Powerful story about a man's dedication to his country and what war can do to someone once they come home. Incredibly well acted by Bradley Cooper and the direction from Clint Eastwood sets this film above many of his others. Can be difficult to watch at times because war is very rough but this one is definitely recommended.
,,"[Clint Eastwood's] gripping, incurious film gives the impression of having not so much been directed as dictated. It stares so fixedly down the rifle sight that it is finally guilty of tunnel vision.","Intense, Emotional, Controversial and yet Engaging"
,,"Propulsive battle sequences in which sandstorms make the fog of war quite literal are the ostensible focus of American Sniper, but the real tension comes from our anticipation of how they'll affect the life this sharpshooter is reluctant to return to until he feels he's done everything he possibly can.","""American Sniper"" is a well-shot Drama/Action film of 2015. The plot to ""American Sniper"" is a man named ""Chris Kyle"" portrayed by ""Bradley Cooper"" is sent out as a sniper to fight in the Iraq war. He later meets a woman named ""Taya"" portrayed by ""Sienna Miller"" who he eventually marries and has children with. The movie just shows ""Chris Kyle"" as he goes on his tours as a sniper. The movie starts off with a dark opening of ""Chris Kyle"" about to shoot a child with a bomb. This scene is dark, but should not have been the movie's first scene. The majority of the movie is ""Chris"" going on his military tours. The film's climax is both thrilling and suspenseful. It makes a great scene and a great climax. The plot to the movie is good; the characters aren't really shown as well as they should have. ""Bradley Cooper"" has once again shown the audience how much of an incredible actor he is. The music in this movie captures the sadness, thrill and suspense of scenes. ""Sienna Miller"" is an okay actress but in this movie it doesn't fell as if she's putting in 100% . As mentioned before ""American Sniper"" was filmed beautifully, the action sequences are thrilling because of director ""Clint Eastwood"". One thing that is very noticeable is the ""Blood Squibs"", pretty much every person who gets shot has a blood squib. The ""Blood Squibs"" are made using C.G.I. there are some scenes that the C.G.I. is very noticeable. If you are a person who enjoys ""Clint Eastwood's"" latest movies then I recommend you watch ""American Sniper"" as it has good acting, great visuals and suspenseful music. Although the movie does have some issues some being characters being unnoticeable, less C.G.I. and better directing. I give 2014's ""American Sniper"" a 7/10."
,,"American Sniper may be the hardest, truest movie ever made about the experience of men in war. Why? Because there’s no glory in it.",A beautifully well crafted action movie by the great Clint Eastwood
,,,Bradley Cooper Gives One Of The Best Performances Of His Career.
,,,Powerful and Poignant
,,,"Fantastic - Views On The War Aside, A Great Movie"
,,,Amazing performance by cooper. Overall a great film that you will watch more then once
,,,Brutal and Powerful; American Sniper ranks among the best of the year
,,,"Action, Romance, and Drama all wrapped into one!"
,,,Epitaph of Great American Hero is Eastwood's Best Film
,,,"First time giving an 1/10 on IMDb. With great expectation on a highly Oscar-Nominated movie staring profound actor Bradley Cooper, which turned me down so much after witnessing a movie with empty perspective but only self-ego of American."
,,,American Sniper is a Masterpiece Clint Eastwood is in my book 1 of the top five directories of all time.
,,,"Chris Kyle was the most lethal sniper in the U.S. military history. He apparently killed more than 250 Iraqui insurgents, though the Pentagon only credited him around 160, which nevertheless made him a legend of the U.S. Army. I started to read the book last year but stopped doing it since I first heard about the project. Eastwood and Cooper on board, that is promising. And of course they both deliver, and ""American Sniper"" is dense and blunt, quite like a shot."
,,,This film was a bit different than I expected. Originally I thought it was going to be about all the action during wartime but I was surprised that it was just as much about the family at home. I liked how they tried to show the struggle Kyle had with shooting insurgents and his home life.
,,,"Best joke the movie told is that the super hardcore trained, specially equipped top shot of the US military is still less capable than the evil, blood thirsty, cliché terrorist with his centuries old rifle. Fun fact terrorist hits 3 guys, super great sniper only 1 despite having an advantage in technology, training and what not. What an incredible bad testimony to the US military, to honor such a failure and child slaughtering maniac as a ""hero""."
,,,"The movie appears to be one of those super long commercials to lure young folks into serving in the army, fighting wars no one knows why, obediently serving the cash money brothers from wall street."
,,,This is not a movie! This is the new marketing strategy of the American army to get stupid people to join.
,,,"Heavy, real, raw. A story told with a snipers precision"
,,,"AMERICAN SNIPER the legend of the fallen foot soldier from the wastelands. Wastelands are from the continent of the south with 'Boys in Stripped pajamas' in the middle of the borders. Missions like climbing KATMANDU is forever obstructed by clouds. 'Sniping, a target on counter strike source' is forbidden like a fool's gold; Marxist joke in ""AMERICAN SNIPER."""
,,,Not for entertainment! Participate if you like Propaganda!
,,,"This movie is pure propaganda. All the people giving this movie positive reviews and raving about it shows me just how ignorant our country has really become. Instead of questioning our direction as a whole we praise and support junk like this film. There is nothing ""Patriotic"" about this film. If anything it shows the world just how stupid we are as a whole."
,,,Fine movie (based on a real story) about a skilled and strong but broken hero and the price war takes on all sides. Good.
,,,one of the best war+melodrama movies ever... best of Eastwood in a decade.

Birdman,Oscar,"A sprawling, thrilling film that, for better and worse, is one of the most fully realized personal visions to hit screens in years.","I love movies like this that take radical chances with their storytelling techniques. Everything about Alejandro González Iñárritu's Birdman is thrilling: the performances, music and the one-take approach its visuals."
,,Two hours of Birdman is 110 minutes too many.,"ith a poignant script and a realm of outstanding performances from all casts members alike, held together by a thrilling direction, Birdman is a competent movie in any cinematic aspect, being one of those rare independents films that are capable of becoming a crowd pleaser, with its themes easily approchable by anyone who dares to enjoy them, easily being most ambitious work yet by talented director Alejandro González Iñarritu."
,,"When it comes to filmmaking, the Michael Keaton-starring Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a unique achievement in cinema.","Michael Keaton delivers a career resurrecting, layered performance as a washed-up superhero movie star trying to reinvent himself. We are presented with some impressive cinematography, and bold direction from Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Birdman works on every level as an impressive piece of cinematic storytelling."
,,"Birdman is essentially a simple story that is made extraordinary by its direction, cast and concept.","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is not only the best film of 2014, but one of the best films ever. PERIOD! This movie is masterfully directed by the incredibly talented Alejandro G. Iñárritu who puts his heart and soul into everything he does. The brilliance of the movie's plot and structure can only be surpassed by the brilliance of the actors in the movie. Michael Keaton gives the performance of his career as the ambitious Riggan Thompson who is desperate to leave a legacy that doesn't include a birdmask and a weird spandex costume. Edward Norton plays ... well, himself, basically, but he does that in the most wonderful way you can possibly imagine. The cinematography is off the chain as the movie continues for many different sections without making a single cut. The beautifully crafted poetry that is this movie definitely deserves all the accolades that it got and even more to it."
,,It's one of the most invigorating and passionately rendered films you could hope to see in this or any other year.,Watching Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu’s multilayered “Birdman” is like unfolding a piece of intricate origami; it keeps opening in unexpected directions.
,,"Birdman is essentially a simple story that is made extraordinary by its direction, cast and concept.","A dizzying, extravagant, colorful, inventive aria that ought to have blessed a magnificent Keaton with an Oscar. ""Story is truth dressed up as fiction,"" has never been more true than this ambitious fantasy about ambition and its regrettable costs."
,,Ed Norton and Emma Stone are both devastating. And Michael Keaton walks a high wire with his meta portrait of the actor as a washed-up superhero. Birdman's juicy script is rife with satirical insights about acting and writing.,"There seems to be quite a bit of contention surrounding this film-I found it to be absolutely hilarious, and was by far my favorite Michael Keaton performance."
,,It's one of the most invigorating and passionately rendered films you could hope to see in this or any other year.,"Not just an amazing technical achievement, Birdman is also a well-acted, well-written movie with a compelling story and great editing tricks resulting in a movie that definitely earns its Best Picture Oscar."
,,"Birdman sidesteps the inside baseball stigma of most behind the scenes films by transcending being a story about fame or Hollywood. Rather, it functions as a sobering meditation on the destructive double-edged sword of validation.",Impressive in its cinematography but its story makes me sick.
,,"Despite its lack of clarity, conflicting thematic messages and indecipherable tone, the film is the rarest of oddities: accidental genius.","Craziness of the first scene grabbed me, and then the tortured but captivating protagonist kept me watching through to the end, mixing fantasy, imagination, fears and the human drive to create something of importance"
,,"Bravura filmmaking, a jaw-dropping directorial feat for Iñárritu.","Very strange movie but the way the characters are portrayed somehow gets you emotionally connected to some of them. Hard to explain without watching it, so go watch it."
,,,Has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen
,,,"One of my favourite films. Amazing pace, Drumming effect was really effective, the way it seemed to be shot as one shot makes it brilliant. it combined both superhero blockbuster and theatrical philosophical work which is just great. BIRDMAN 2 please x"
,,,The drumming by Antonio Sanchez is fantastic in this movie
,,,Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) was the best movie released in 2014.
,,,"The first time I watched this movie when it came out I found it strange but interesting. The second timeI loved it. An existential and psychological movie that never gets boring or goes too far. I Love it, but is not for everyone."
,,,"Amazing. Probably my favourite film of all time due to the stylisation, filming and cinematography which makes Birdman a must see for anyone who enjoys film. Easier to appreciate if you are a film geek, the jazz music keeps the film running smoothly and the fact that it appears to be in one take makes it feel non-stop. Michael Keaton plays the role excellently and it was an amazing casting; a film about a washed up superhero actor played by a washed up superhero actor! Saying that, this film seems to have saved his career and you can see why, his acting alongside Edward Norton and Emma Stone is incredible. Very surreal at times, this film makes the audience escape into the imaginary and the air of fantasy makes it all the more spontaneous and exciting."
,,,"What an incredible piece of work... the worst movie I have ever seen by these successful actors.... it rates in my top ten worst movies EVER....not entertaining at all...""Wait for it.... Wait for it....and it never delivers""...."
,,,"You could argue that Birdman tries just a little too hard sometimes to make a case for itself as an artful movie about, well...art, but once everything is said and done, this is a film that isn't just about Michael Keaton's stunning performance and path to redemption. It's also a meticulously shot and technically ambitious feature. That's where it gets most of its strength from. Neither outstanding element truly overshadows the other. They complement each other to tell the story and study the characters in it"
,,,"What a strange movie. Michael Keaton plays a past his prime actor in theater who was once the star of a blockbuster movie series in the early 90s aka ""Birdman"". The Birdman character remains as an alter ego that speaks to him subconsciously and he has vivid fantasies of having super powers in real life. At least I think they are fantasies. Michael Keaton's performance is amazing but I'm really not sure what to make of this movie."
,,,"While there are a couple of parts where characters explain their feelings, which is pretty annoying, Birdman is mostly a very good exploration of fame and the loss of it in the most bizarre way possible."
,,,The star of the movie is the director
,,,At times surreal and very existential...Iñárritu showcases his knack for telling a compelling story and his use of relatable characters in a strange yet oddly enthralling tale.
,,,An absolute masterpiece that commands attention from beginning to end. Camera work is solid as it flows with the story like a work of poetry. The fantastical elements of the story leaves adds another layer of complexity to the entire movie. 4.5/5. A gem to the eyes
,,,"Another summation of an ambitious original screenplay. Hats off Michael Keaton , Edward Norton and Emma Stone for delivering such impeccable performances."
,,,"Boring as hell, movie made for movie makers."
,,,"Absolute garbage, pretentious, open-ended and relying on the gimmick of the longshot. Add some misleading trailers to boot and you've got the movie I usually coin as the biggest disappointment"
,,,Great movie. Puts in the mind of the character.
,,,"Love this film. For me, it's got just the right balance of different levels of comedy ranging from slapstick to grotesque humour. Perfectly shot, perfectly written and perfectly acted."
,,,"Excellent story, beautifully shot, awesome soundtrack. With literal flights of fancy. Keaton perfect in this."
,,,Way too emotional. Makes no sense.
,,,This movie didn't feel like a movie at all. It just felt like it was a video took behind the creation of a movie. Recommended to everyone.
,,,"Everything about this film was intentional, and impactful. The cinematography, soundtrack, shots, dialogue... and it comes together as breathtaking mess of a masterpiece."

Boyhood,Oscar,It's terrifying. It's heartbreaking. Boyhood catches that perfectly.,"Many thought this movie was boring. I don't watch movies just to be entertained. I don't need car chase scenes or guns or superheroes. I also watch movies to learn something, or to get insight into another life or another culture, so I enjoyed this movie. What held my interest was the dysfunctional family, and seeing how the mother handled abuse. I did not see warning signs of these evil men when the mother was dating them, so she didn't seem to be one of those idiot-women who let themselves be shoved around by some ogre-of-a-man. I experienced an emotionally abusive husband (he was never physically abusive), so I'm so very curious to see how other women handle this. I had wonderful parents, so it was hard for me to understand what the kids were going through. I tried to put myself in the kids' shoes, and wondered how I would handle such a bully of a father. I'd like to think I'd say, ""Go away, you slob!"" and report him, but easier said than done. A good film won't depict a character as all good or all bad, so as a kid, you're confused when they are kind. Abusers apologize a lot and give flowers. At first, I wondered if the the father was just disciplining the kids, making them do their homework and chores. You do have to get on kids. Then it went too far. I was glad when the mother took her kids out of the abusive home. I wanted to shake the daughter who whined because she now didn't have her own room and had to go to a different school. Teens can be so very self-absorbed. It made me wonder if I was this selfish when I was a teen. Ethan Hawk's character was interesting. He seemed hyper, always ""on"" with his inner pistons going full throttle. While he was a screw-up when he was young, he had a kind heart and matured throughout the movie. His latest wife calmed him. It was interesting to me to see the aging process all in one movie. I was surprised the boy was solid and light-haired as a young boy, then extremely skinny and black-haired as an older teen. He went from 'average kid' to 'super cool dude.' All in all, this movie did what it sought out to accomplish - showing an ordinary life of a boy."
,,"A seamless portrait of childhood, adolescence and parenting that is at times arresting and aggravatingly uninteresting.","This movie was always predicted to be a masterpiece. With a filming schedule that expanded over 12 years, how could this movie not be the most interesting thing ever. Well, the movie is good, but is it the best movie of 2014? No. Not at all. Many things in this movie are great for example the performances by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are flawless. Ellar Coltrane who plays the young Mason takes his time to find the right perspective of the character, but that was only to be expected as he, literally, grew during production of the film. The movie, however, have some really sloppy moments. At many points, the script doesn't seem like it was thought through and you get the feeling that Richard Linklater just wrote the script without knowing what direction he wanted to go. His directing, however, is almost flawless, as he really gets the emotion in this young boy and his parents and captures the perfect escence of what makes this family what it is."
,,"It's so epic in scope, but extraordinarily intimate in its storytelling.","A charming drama that amuses and captivates the audience and takes them on a journey of growing up, love and heartbreak. Fantastic cast and beautifully done!"
,,"Stylistically, Boyhood is exceptional, and Linklater's foresight with technology and culture is something to be revered.","Excellent. This was a fantastic film, and honestly I would have been happy if this had won Best Picture. It definitely would have deserved it. Boyhood is a far superior film to Birdman."
,,Coming of age.,"Interesting. It wasn't super exciting but the writting was good, it felt like a book."
,,"It's so epic in scope, but extraordinarily intimate in its storytelling.","With dizzying ambition, this seemingly pointless ramble through time feels hollow and incidental. The ending point feels arbitrary and unsatisfying. It's very well acted and the production values are good, but the sum is not anywhere near as great as the parts. The message appears to be that our lives, much like this movie about it, are not in any way special and ultimately disappointing."
,,"Boyhood isn't a masterpiece because of its approach. It's a masterpiece because, in the space of one viewing, it redeemed an entire genre for me and made me feel specific emotions I haven't had since I was just a teenager.",This is the most true to life movie that's ever been made when you think about it. When you get to the end you just want to die
,,It is a fearless experiment by one of the most groundbreaking directors of our time.,"""Okay""/""Decent""/""Watchable"""
,,A true honest-to-goodness landmark that will be looked back on for years to come as one of the defining films of our time.,"One of the most uniquely honest, refreshing films I've ever seen."
,,This was so bold and so different.,I thought it was the best movie of the year. 12 years to make and it shows
,,"It is an incredible film; a power walk through the chapters of childhood and adolescence, an epic poem of candid photographs sellotaped together with strips of sticky, sugary nostalgia.","DID YOU HEAR THAT THIS MOVIE TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE?!? THAT MAKES IT AUTOMATICALLY A MASTERPIECE, BECAUSE NOTHING IN THE HISTORY OF EVER HAS TAKEN 12 YEARS TO MAKE!! I ALSO LOVED THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT MAKING OF THIS MOVIE, CALLED ""12 YEARS A SLAVE""! IT REALLY CAPTURES THE PROCESS OF THIS WORLD CHANGING MOVIE!!!"
,,"It is an incredible film; a power walk through the chapters of childhood and adolescence, an epic poem of candid photographs sellotaped together with strips of sticky, sugary nostalgia.","This movie has really interesting and ambitious concept and does some things right, and there are some good scenes and performances, particularly from Ethan Hawk who is great. But the problem is that if your going to try this ambitious gimmick of shooting over 12 years, and making 3 hours long with no real story, than you need to make sure your script is consistent, very engaging, has good character development, and has some over-arching theme and this movie fails at almost all of that. And at the end of the day it felt like nothing more than a whatever drama movie with a bunch of pointless scenes and a meandering story, and to add insult to injury there are some pretty bad moments scattered throughout. Overall, it's definitely a 2-star movie as this movie gets a lot of things right and is definitely trying, but it still kind of sucks."
,,,"Spending 12 years to make a movie one would think you would take a risk with the story as well. This was 3 hours of nothing. A fictional story they chose to barely have any conflict, character growth, ir challenges."
,,,"Although it's a long movie not once did I find it boring or slow, it was captivating watching Mason grow from a boy to a man and I found the situations he faces throughout his journey to be relatable that draws you in even further. The entire cast give good performances but Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette steal the show."
,,,"This was a tough one to figure out. The children did not grow up to become good actors, but maybe that is the genius of this movie; Their teenage years were awkward and hard to watch. We can all relate to that."
,,,A coming-of-age story that is both beautiful and relatable...with amazing performances from Ethan Hawke and Ellar Coltrane.
,,,This is one of my top 3 movies of all time all Genre's. The amount of time and effort that went into this. It was real. It had a beautiful story and will forever be a classic to me. MUST WATCH
,,,One of the greatest innovative films I've ever seen. Masterfully crafted into a film that feels like everything is genuine and not scripted whatsoever. An absolute must see for everyone
,,,"The film is like no other, continuously using the same actors for over a decade to create a connection between the viewers and Mason Jr. You'd think that this would create a visually unpleasant change of quality but the crew did a great job of keeping everything the same throughout the years. Overall a really great ‘coming of age' film."
,,,"leaves a deep mark onto your heart. you can't see this and not feel anything personal towards the actors, you just saw their entire growth and development, through the film and through their life."
,,,"I wanted to love Boyhood, but I really couldn't. The concept of filming a movie over the course of 12 years and actually watching the actors grow up is a very impressive achievement, but as a narrative, I feel like that's where the film suffers. The editing is very off in this movie. Things come and go out of nowhere and are often never mentioned again. I get it, things like that happen in our lives, but narratively, those plot points serve no purpose. There are also some very annoying shove-in-your-face references of what year a certain scene takes place in. Whether it's someone complaining about George W. Bush (and this is coming from a guy who's not a fan of Bush, either), a girl singing a song from High School Musical, or a kid referencing his 3 favorite movies of 2008 (Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight, and Pineapple Express). Those references really date the film and it's very distracting. For me, I'll stick to Moonlight. A much better film in my opinion."
,,,the concept is original hence 2 stars but with a three hour time i barely made it through it without falling asleep and my wife agreed but i am glad other people connected with it
,,,"The elephant in the room is that this conceptual masterpiece is obviously well-executed, but it's just a boring and depressing slog. I'll never watch it again, though I'm glad I saw it from an artistic point of view."
,,,Very Good movie. Was Heartwarming and enjoyable.
,,,Unique film making in every sense of the word.
,,,"Boring. There's no story, just an overlong trip down someone else's memory lame (not a typo)."
,,,Perhaps one of the most powerful movies the history of film. What sets this above all others is its ability to transcend the screen and bring the viewer into the life of mason.There is something for everyone in this movie.
,,,Excellent! Very well done and creative in its use of the same actors over long periods of time.
,,,Very slow with mediocre acting.
,,,"A magnificent and sprawling portrait of a boy's life from childhood to late adolescence, shot in an extraordinary span of twelve years, that provides a thoroughly captivating and enriching experience thanks to its engaging performances and insightful direction."
,,,"The movie is just breathing, its a three hours of fresh air! It is perfect as it is and worth any minute. I'm so happy that I found this movie on my boxxy software."
,,,"A documentary that pushes the boundaries, revealing the behind-the-scenes of growing up in a raw display of tremendous authenticity."
,,,"A bit of a gimmick if you ask me. Didn’t resonate with me in any way. The performances were good, but nothing outstanding."
,,,One of a kind masterpiece. Watching this kid grow and change and all he goes through is great.Seeing the end pulls on the heart strings for sure.

THE GRAND BUDAPEST,,The desire to show fantastic worlds and tell stories in the face of the inevitable march of time and destructive forces is at the core of the film. Anderson's films are beginning to show the soul beneath the exactitude.,"This is a very funny movie. Wes Anderson is really good at making these very different films that people are just captured by. This movie just proves that his talent is really unlimited. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant in this movie, but then again he always is. Then again, his performance in this movie really brought his career to a new point, because he really is a dramatic actor as seen in movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The English Patient."" The fact that he can do a performance like this, which is basically a comedic performance, is just once again proving why he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood. He has beautiful chemistry with the young Tony Revolori who is also very good in this movie."
,,The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fast-paced beautiful spectacle that never ceases to amuse you.,"A host of comic book characters in typical Wes Anderson style set in a fantasy country not unlike Eastern Europe in a fantasy time not unlike the 1930s with pretty and playful cinematography not unlike a Jeunet movie. Another tour de force by Ralph Fiennes, the sophisticated hotel proprietor dedicated to bringing civilisation to the uncouth ""modern"" age."
,,"Magnificent and magical, once you check-in, you'll never want to check-out.","The Grand Budapest Hotel did not have many laugh out loud moments; rarely did I more than grin or chuckle. But I was laughing on the inside and found the film very enjoyable to the extent that I was wishing I had not returned the DVD because I wanted to watch it again [which I have since first writing this review]. Something about it is very Oscar Wilde, aesthetic and witty."
,,"To alter a phrase from Batman, who won't mind because he's not real, The Grand Budapest Hotel is the movie audiences deserve and the one Anderson needed.","Wes Anderson's delightfully quirky, visually striking, surrealistic comedy about Gustave H, played marvelously by Ralph Fiennes, with a dead-pan comic seriousness, who is a perfectionist concierge of this famous and luxurious hotel. Pleasing his customers is his number one priority, even if that means having sex with the aging doyennes. Then there is Gustave H's adoring and trusty sidekick, Zero, the lobby boy, wonderfully played by young Tony Revolori, in a scene-stealing performance, he is a stoic and observant pupil, whose painted on pencil mustache suggests that perhaps he shares some of his mentor's rarefied tastes. Soon mayhem will hit the grand hotel in the form of murder, revenge and a sinister dark plot. Brilliant direction by Wes Anderson, with terrific supporting performances by F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amairic, Adrien Brody, Williem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Kietel, Jude Law, Billy Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Tom Wilkinson. Impressive cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman, and a sensational score by Alexandre Desplat. An absurdly funny and original madcap comedy. Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Highly Recommended."
,,"Those of you who worship at the auteur altar of the director, who have long embraced his fastidious, meticulous style of studied nostalgia and to-the-inch symmetrical specificity, need no prodding.",Incredibly Fun Movie. Had me rolling
,,"Anderson's particular aesthetic can sometimes serve to keep the audience at arm's length, but here it achieves something deeply beautiful, even warm and inviting.","When we went and saw this movie, the lady at the cinema told us if you don't like it in the first 20 minutes, come out and you can have your money back. This is the first time anyone has ever warned us about seeing a movie. It was really wierd."
,,What the film amounts to is nothing more than a well-done and admirable piece of fluff.,"Although the movie was a bit cucky, as are all Wes Anderson films, this is one of the most aesthetically pleasing movies ever made"
,,"The sometimes erratic tone and plot machinations mean it may not be perfect, but ignore your reservations and check in to The Grand Budapest Hotel.","The most Wes Anderson movie from Wes Anderson is also among his best. A hilarious script, gorgeous set decoration and cinematography, and a fantastic ensemble cast combine to make this great entertainment."
,,A cat and mouse chase with a lot of humor and whimsey.,"Nobody makes movies like Wes Anderson, and this movie is yet another support for that claim. This movie was funny, heartfelt, and completely unpredictable. As a result this movie does tension very well while still keeping the tone from getting dark. Also the performances in this movie! Wow!"
,,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is immense fun and, as far as Anderson's oeuvre is concerned, unquestionably the rarest of fillet steak.","Bold, imaginative, star-studded and charming; ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is not a film you'll forget anytime soon."
,,"It is certainly a magical and childlike way of storytelling, even if the content is a little more adult.",The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favorite movie of all time. Wes Anderson is favorite director and this is his best movie. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori make an excellent duo in this absolute must see masterpiece.
,,,Everything about this film is perfect.
,,,"Amazing, inspirational, captivating, and very entertaining. Stunning visuals, and great acting. Definitely one of my favorites."
,,,An instant classic. Ralph Fiennes sets the tone for the movie with his over the top style. Great storytelling. And loved the performances by Adrien Brody and Willem Defoe
,,,"Another great feat from Wes Anderson...Grand Budapest has all the quirky charm, pleasant cinematography and sharp dialogue we've come to love and appreciate!"
,,,"Magnificent! it´s just wonderful! the genuine way to tell a beautiful and enriching story. Wes Anderson display of colors, symmetrical scenes and elaboration of characters are top notch, just perfection. If you want to see a movie that can be compared as the most delicious and delighted piece of a perfectly rounded cake, you should not pass on this work of art."
,,,"Wes Anderson's personal style of creating a movie shine here as he crafts possibly his best film. It's hilarious and tense all at the same time. The typical awkward-comedic dialogue works splendidly and the setting of the hotel, snowy mountains and city landscapes in the '30s are visually amazing. Ralph Fiennes is a great lead as the hotel concierge. Wes Anderson keep on making movies like these."
,,,Wes Anderson's unique brand of filmmaking shines in this wonderful little gem of a movie. Great performances and undeniable overall charm.
,,,"Anderson does it again. The third movie of his that I've seen and all got the same score from me. His style is something I really enjoy. Great characters, fun antics, and it all looks beautiful."
,,,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is one of my favourite movies. Everytime I watch it, my heart melts and my eyes cry, that's how beautiful the film is. Even when you focus on a plot, not the visual effects, it's still great. Plot might be confusing at times, but in the end all of it makes absolute sense. I have to point once again, that Wes Anderson did wonderful job. Every frame of a move is a masterpiece."
,,,"Absolutely astounding. Everything about this movie is amazing. I've seen it countless times and I absolutely want to see it again every time! I just adore Wes Anderson's way of directing and storytelling, it's so inspiring that because of him, I aspire to be a director, to be able to tell a story as beautiful as this. It's definitely in my top 10 or top 5 or whatever! it's just amazing and worth seeing."
,,,This movie was fancier than royal tuxedo and more charming than a prince. I managed to be hilarious and heartwarming at the same time and I loved every second and frame of it.
,,,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a snobby, poorly written piece of crap. The characters are incomprehensible, the style is ugly like my dog's vomit, and the humor that doesn't fly over your head is as dry as a desert. The Screenplay is just as bad… Who knows what Anderson was thinking when stuck he scenes together in an unorderly manner such as this. Leave the non-linear storytelling to Quentin Tarantino PLEASE!!!!!!!!"
,,,"This is my favorite film ever made. Its humor, its style, and its relentlessly beautiful expressions of love and companionship come together to make a film that delights just as much the fifth time as the first."
,,,Brilliantly acting and masterful comedy and a fell good film
,,,"Wes Anderson is one of the last executives - auteurs-who has unlimited oversight on the film set and has the ability to make whatever sort of film he wants. His particular visual style has been obvious since his 1996 presentation Bottle Rocket. Be that as it may, that was only a begin, with each film he made he was culminating his system to an ever increasing extent? This superb tender loving care, the manner in which he forms his shots(following shots, the symmetry, the characters running in moderate movement), pursue scenes, romantic tale, sentimentality, illustrative montages, the bright set structure and the common topic of all of his movies: family. This all indicates the motivation behind why the gathering of people makes the most of Anderson's film to such an extent. This all is conveyed to flawlessness in Budapest."
,,,Great filmed movie and great casted.
,,,"It feels like a stage play come to life. Absolutely delightful in its atmosphere, writing, and characters."
,,,"Delicate and lovely, the warmth feeling is thoroughly heartfelt."
,,,"the cinematography in this is great performances were fabulous, i especially liked Adrien Brody"
,,,"The first Wes Anderson movie I've seen...and it made me immediately want to watch the others. A funny, different, stylish piece of work that kept me smiling throughout. Bravo!"
,,,This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece
,,,"One cannot help but praise such a deliciously crafted Wes Anderson world. There's this European winter wonderland essence to it, and yet it does this whilst in its World War setting, ending up with a fully enjoyable mix of action, thriller and a somewhat-puppet like sense of comedy. Pretty much everyone in the ensemble lives up to this idea. My only problem was when I looked back on the film. Sure, Anderson's creativity is well-realized, but I felt this got muddled up with its explorations of nostalgia, and its comic yet dark commentary on the war, which I can't say were extremely memorable. Still though, it's worth a watch"

The Imitation Game,,Benedict Cumberbatch...Mark Strong and Matthew Goode... each delivers enigmatic performances that challenge the audience to think and look below the surface for the truth of each real life character portrayed.,"a sound piece of cinema. mathematics, war and homosexualism. benedict cumberbatch plays the totally not normal genius alan turin passionately. good job"
,,"Though hindsight is always 20/20, The Imitation Game gives us a fair and balanced glance at the tragedies that prejudice and inequality can cause. Turing achieved more in one war-torn decade than Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.","Loved this movie, the acting was phenomenal."
,,It is watchable and entertaining but more importantly it's a movie that reveals to the world a man who's achievements many more should celebrate.,"The true story of Alan Turing is told incredibly well and maturely, It truly does him justice. However, the film lacks a bit of heart to be ""perfect"". It is still a great watch."
,,"Cumberbatch conveys tortured humanity behind the analytical façade, even if we also understand and even chuckle at how frustrating Turing could be to those working with him.",Benedict Cumberbatch gives the best performance of his career to date.
,,"Restrained and tasteful in a very British sort of way, but it almost seems afraid to tackle its subject head on.","The Imitation Game provides for an incredible tribute toward Alan Turning and acknowledges all his war efforts whilst also telling the tragic story of his life. Some of the time-hopping can be confusing but overall, it is an excellent movie in which Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Alan Turning perfectly."
,,"Gorgeously realised, engagingly witty and with great performances all around, The Imitation Game is engrossing and accomplished.","Not a big fan of WWII movies, but this one is worth watching. Lot's of plot twists here and the movie gets much more interesting as it moves along. I suggest using subtitles as the accents can be thick and voices quiet compared to other sounds."
,,"The Imitation Game is a film that will in all likelihood earn Benedict Cumberbatch his first Oscar nomination, for he absolutely shines as Alan Turing in this top-notch biopic.","Benedict Cumberbatch gives a standout performance in this smart, touching, and informative biopic. It's a fascinating story, told with tremendous respect and appreciation for its subject."
,,The Imitation Game purposefully hits the mark in shining the light on one the most heroic figures of the 20th century.,Probably one of the most important movies across all generations. Anyone who has taken our lives for granted at present time must see this to appreciate what we have achieved and what we have become.
,,"To be honest, I'm a bit surprised that there hasn't been more pushback against The Imitation Game by intelligence professionals, historians, and survivors of Turing's circle.","Well acted and fairly compelling story line for what appears to be extremely dry material to begin with. I was familiar with Turing as a founding father of computers and Enigma and the gay thing, but I didn't realize he was autistic or whatever it was as well. Cumberbatch does a great job portraying a tormented introvert. The plot twists seemed a bit much, although supposedly almost all of this actually happened. A couple of complaints: the title is dumb and forgettable, Keira Knightly's character was annoying ('I am super smart and I can help' swings to 'but I have to stay home with my parents'), and the film jumps around in time too much. There was no real reason they needed to present all of that material out of order."
,,"This film is spectacular in its simplicity. The quiet story is filled with intelligence, wit, anger, sadness, triumph and tragedy.","a really wonderful film, sweet, but still dramatic and very sad because it's done so well that you really regret it so much when the protaonists happen something or make a mistake"
,,"This isn't a movie with any ideas about that. It just wants to portray the Turing that beat Enigma, and in that it does a perfectly reasonable job.","Benedict cumberbatch is astonishing, what an actor.. A so well design movie, with a great casting and a great a sentimental way of show us the life of this man and is work."
,,,"A really good movie, absolutely loved it!"
,,,"The Imitation Game is a complex and marvelous tribute to an unrecognized hero of World War II, human rights, and mathematics. Cumberbatch portrays Turing flawlessly."
,,,"Good movie, good actors. Based on a true story so who knows how much is actually fabricated. An autistic man breaks a German code that allows them to win the war."
,,,A heart-breaking film about a brilliant mind...Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing with a good amount of sympathy.
,,,Amazing plot and actor performances.
,,,The movie had soo much potential but was ruined by agendas. I really would have loved it if it kept its focus on the enigma project.
,,,An absolute Masterpiece. This movie was so incredible and amazing.
,,,"Excellent direction, dazzling acting and memorable OST. The movie that ciments Cumberatch as the default ""lost genius"" actor after his role in Sherlock."
,,,"I was pleased to see more critics disappointed with this movie. I was. So disappointed. The acting was fine. But the story is so remedial. So very remedial. The best part of the movie was the history lesson at the very end, in writing."
,,,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, especially being a student of Computer Science. Even for someone with no knowledge of CS, it is a great homage to the man who pioneered computing in the form of a thriller."
,,,"Strong film. Great anticipation, great acting, but a less than satisfying depiction of the end of Turing’s life."
,,,"This is an absolutely forceful, very deep movie with gifted actors. It is based on the original story of life and is touching. The story of the main character is intriguing until the end. This is absolutely powerful story."
,,,"This movie is basically a sequence of scenes, every single one of them very meaningful and deep. Not very vivid. Turing's character is not credible"
,,,A wonderfully indulging movie that depicts the true events of World War II and the challenges that were faced throughout it. Benedict Cumberbatch takes the role of Alan Turing and brings him to life in this captivating true story which will leave you in awe.
,,,The Imitation Game is an incredibly intelligent film with some incredible performances. Benedict Cumberpatch and Keira Knightly are both incredibly skilled and shine in this amazing film. Deserved to win more oscars!
,,,"It was a decent movie. Without Benedict Cumberbatches performance, it would have put me to sleep. The storyline was not effective enough to deliver the emotions it attempted to. They should’ve either chose to make it a thriller and focus solely on cracking enigma, or Turing’s struggle with being persecuted as a homosexual. It would have been a lot more powerful if they only chose one to center on."
,,,"The film was absolutely great, the dialogue was written very beautifully and the acting by all cast members were terrific. The opening and introduction was done extremely well, giving us all the necessary information and character introduction which allows for the plot to develop. The way that the story and plot progresses is slow, and steady, we get a sense of unease from this and the director has truly created a suspenseful, entertaining and touching film. I just can't say enough about this movie!"
,,,It was a good movie with substance. I am not one for watching classical type of movies like that but this one got me eating from the screen of the tv.
,,,Brilliant and gripping true story
,,,"Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, ""The Imitation Game"" tackles a modern subject using a World War II story and backdrop. Conceptually, the story of the mathematician-turned-British cryptographer working with a team to create the earliest known computer that broke Germany's Enigma Machine, is fascinating. Unfortunately, the dialogue is cheesy, unnecessarily over-dramatized and over-acted. It wasn't until the very end when the machine finally worked and Alan was having to deal with the law-breaking activity of homosexuality that the theme became as powerful as it had intended. Unfortunately, that was the last 15 minutes of an otherwise boring two-hour film. While the performances weren't bad, calling anything about this film Oscar-worthy is a stretch."
,,,"an amazing tale, oriented around the pinnacle moment of deciphering enigma. looking into the life of alan turing, dealing with interpersonal and social issues and stigma endured by himself and the team of cryptographers. brilliant acting by the entire cast, great costume and well-scripted."
,,,"A brilliantly riveting film that keeps the audience glued to the screen. Such an incredibly well told, amazing story should leave one with nothing less than goosebumps!"
,,,"This film delivers a beautiful commemoration to perhaps the most influential person in the history of computing and a man who contributed so much to the Allied war effort. The performances given, particularly by Cumberbatch and Knightly, were deeply moving and the history of the work done at Bletchley Park was done great justice. As a work of dramatic fiction this would have been a great story but as an account of actual events this film is remarkable and unmissable."
,,,"Sad, real and questioning, The Imitation Game is a film that you will remember for both emotional and plot strength."
