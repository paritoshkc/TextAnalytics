Call Me by Your Name,Oscar,"The debt to pleasure is deferred in exquisite style for this ravishingly beautiful movie set in Northern Italy in the early 80s: a coming-of-age love story between a precocious teenage boy and a slightly older man. Their summer romance is saturated with poetic languor and a deeply sophisticated sensuality.

The film is directed by Luca Guadagnino (who made I Am Love and A Bigger Splash) and adapted from the novel by André Aciman by James Ivory, who had originally been slated to co-direct and has a producer credit. Ivory’s presence inevitably calls to mind his film version of EM Forster’s Maurice, to which this is frankly superior. For me, it brought back Alan Hollinghurst novels such as The Folding Star and The Spell. Call Me By Your Name is an erotic pastoral that culminates in a quite amazing speech by Michael Stuhlbarg, playing the boy’s father. It’s a compelling dramatic gesture of wisdom, understanding and what I can only call moral goodness. Stuhlbarg plays Perlman, a middle-aged American professor of classical antiquity living with his stylish wife Annella (Amira Casar), in a handsome Italian house with their son, Elio – a remarkable performance from Timothée Chalamet – who is a very talented musician, spending his time transcribing Schoenberg and composing piano variations on JS Bach. Theirs is a cultured household, in which everyone is proficient in English, French, Italian and, for Annella, German. The family is also Jewish. Elio calls them “Jews of discretion”, a sense of otherness that is to serve as a metaphor for concealed sexuality.  Elio slopes and mopes about the huge house as the long hot summer commences, grumpy and moody, not knowing what to do with himself or his directionless sexuality, shooing away flies, frowning over paperbacks, dressed mostly in nothing more than shorts, all shoulder blades and hairless calves. Every year, his dad invites a favoured grad student to spend the summer with the family to help him with research. This year it is the impossibly handsome and statuesque Oliver, played by , who never wears a pair of long trousers in the entire film. He establishes his academic credentials early on by presuming to correct Perlman’s derivation of the word “apricot”. Both Elio and Oliver are to have romantic associations with local young women, but it is more than clear where this is heading. And when the main event arrives, Guadagnino’s camera wanders tactfully away from their bed, gazing thoughtfully out of the window at the hot summer night.  What is perhaps so incredible is the concept of leisure, a cousin to pleasure, pure gorgeous indolence and sexiness for six whole weeks. No one appears to have very much to do in the way of dreary work, despite the references to typing up pages and cataloguing slides. People sunbathe; they impetuously jump up and go swimming, have unhurried meals al fresco, cycle into town to drink in bars, or play volleyball. The main work-related activity is when Perlman and Oliver go to inspect a sensational discovery: parts of a classical statue recovered from a lake. Hellenic sensuality is resurrected in concert with the not-so-secret sexual tumult emerging all about.


Armie Hammer on gay romance Call Me By Your Name: ‘There were fetishes I didn’t understand’

At any one time, nothing is happening, and everything is happening. Elio and Oliver will catch each other’s eye in their adjoining bedrooms or downstairs in the hall; they will casually notice each other changing into swimming costumes. Each of these intensely realised, superbly controlled and weighted moments is as gripping as a thriller. Hammer’s Oliver is worldlier than Elio, but not a roué or a cynic; in an odd way, Elio is more cosmopolitan than Oliver. The visiting American looks like a mix of Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf.

Chalamet’s performance as Elio is outstanding, especially in an unbearably sad sequence, when he has to ring his mum from a payphone and ask to be driven home. (In that scene, Guadagnino contrives to show an old lady fanning herself in the right-hand side of the frame. Was she an actor? A non-professional who just happened to be there? Either way, there is a superb rightness to it.) And then there is Stuhlbarg’s speech advising against the impulse to cauterise or forget pain: “We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.” There is such tenderness to this film. I was overwhelmed by it.","Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we're living in, it's like a shock. I wept like I hadn't wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that."
,,"There is a moment just before a teenage crush bursts its dam and becomes a fully fledged first love. It’s a moment in which time is briefly suspended; it’s that shiver of uncertainty before you dive over the edge of the waterfall into the kind of love you could drown in. It’s this – the exquisite torture of not knowing if feelings are reciprocated followed by the helpless flood of emotions – that is captured so intensely and urgently in this gorgeous work of yearning. Director Luca Guadagnino has a gift for romance.  This adaptation of the novel of the same name by André Aciman, penned by James Ivory, forms the concluding part of Guadagnino’s Desire trilogy, following I Am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015). Of the two, the new film has far more in common with the lush, luxuriant sensuality of the former than the crackling comedy and riotous misbehaviour of the latter.

Both Call Me By Your Name and I Am Love explore the dance between two people who are uncontrollably attracted to each other. In this case, it is Elio (Timothée Chalamet), the precociously cultured 17-year-old son of an archaeology professor (Michael Stuhlbarg), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), the emphatically confident American graduate student interning with the professor and his family at their Bertoluccian summer home in Lombardy. It’s uncharted territory for both. They posture and pose for each other, shirtless and sun-kissed, but there’s an uncertainty that makes both hold back. For a while at least.

In the meantime, Guadagnino fills the frame with images that are fairly throbbing with symbolic resonance. The boys’ two bicycles leaning against a wall, intertwined, one handle bar hooked through the frame of the other. The camera lingers on ripe fruit of the villa’s orchard – peaches figure prominently, and creatively. Cigarettes are passed, with offhand intimacy, from lips to lips. Having evocatively used excerpts of John Adams’s The Chairman Dances in I Am Love, Guadagnino once again marries music to the movie with an instinctive eloquence. In an acknowledgment of the teenage central character – Elio is a gifted multi-instrumentalist – piano features heavily. There’s a hopeful rippling motif, which swirls and eddies like Elio’s adolescent hormones. The film’s setting, in 1983, also makes its presence known, in the form of a few endearingly cheesy period pop songs. Most potent are the wistful original compositions by Sufjan Stevens, played on heartstrings and angst, which give the emotional trajectory of the story a stinging rawness.

But for all the confidence of the film-making, the thing that really elevates this picture to one of the very best of the year is the exceptional quality of the performances. On a second viewing, I become fascinated by Amira Casar, playing Elio’s mother, Anella. Her clear, calm gaze locks on to her husband and her son as she translates a German fable to them, asking unspoken questions of both. “Is it better to speak or to die?” Stuhlbarg, meanwhile, carries a remarkable scene, perhaps the most important in the film. It’s a speech in which he effectively rips open his chest and bares his heart to his son. Hammer, while technically a little mature for the role, captures the gilded alpha male certainty that makes Oliver so attractive; the casually decisive way that he moves through the world unsettles Elio. And Chalamet, with his restless, impatient physicality and a face as sensual and sculpted as a fallen angel from a Caravaggio painting, is quite simply astonishing. The final scene of the film – the camera rests on Elio’s face in the foreground as he processes his heartbreak – is first love encapsulated in one, sumptuously sad, single shot.","This is the kind of film that you see in 'Coming Attractions' and you think that though it sounds interesting enough to see, it will never live up to its hype. And still you go see it. And yet, even though you knew the buzz for the film was overblown, you are even more disappointed upon leaving the theater than you were prepared to be. This is sub-mediocre cinema for the pretentious mass of moviegoers.

For one thing, it was way too long, at least a half hour more than necessary. Too many wasted, extended shots that did nothing to advance the paper-thin narrative of Vulnerable Younger Man Elio falls for Manipulative Young Man Oliver, involving themselves in a six-week summer fling with full parental approval. Oliver has his peach and eats it too, then moves back to the United States to proceed with his pre-planned heterosexual lifestyle. Elio is then left to pine and yearn and mourn with a beautiful sad-face through the closing credits. Two hours and ten minutes for this? No thank you, sirs.

About the performances: Armie Hammer is a truly beautiful physical specimen of a man, but in this film that is the full extent of his acting ability. Preening, with an exaggerated sense of dismissive cool, his portrayal of Oliver left the sense of an actor trying too hard to pretend that he was comfortable in the role. This sense is re-inforced in the promotional interviews for the film, where he seems to be working just a bit too hard to show how cool he was with kissing and simulating sex with another beautiful young(er) man. The utter sterility of the sex scenes or the lack of explicit nudity, however, as dictated by Hammer's contract, belie his overcompensating demeanor. Understandable, perhaps, but this kills the credibility of any emotional chemistry beyond the two men on- screen.

Timothée Chalamet, on the other hand, is remarkable in the way he inhabits his role, with a kittenish physicality, all lean, wiry lines and lithe angles, that more than holds its own in the scenes with Hammer. Despite the unbelievability of any emotional connection between the two characters, Chalamet's Elio gives a palpable sense of physical attraction to the older Oliver, a man-crush that gives way to physical yearning. The depth of Chalamet's performance was what carried the film, and was by far the most interesting, successful aspect of the production.

The novel could actually be interesting, but as brought to screen it was diffuse, dissolute, and disparate; like a collage attempting to depict a mosaic of a mural. This film will get praise for dealing with a sensitive subject, and I suppose that is fair enough; I only wish it had been more interestingly and convincingly executed."
,,"Another young man's summer he'll never forget is the core of Call Me By Your Name, a movie to likewise treasure. Luca Guadagnino's coming out-of-age drama is a rare exception to familiar romantic rules.

This film's same-sex summer fling shared by a teenage prodigy and post-grad student is romance by means of intelligence, both shared and artistically expressed. Movies don't usually sound this smart, or look this minutely picturesque, in 1980's period and seemingly every leaf of its Northern Italy setting.

Call Me By Your Name makes eyes and ears swoon, so the heart has little choice but to follow. It's a movie one wishes to live in, speaking the way these characters do. The screenplay by James Ivory, 89, bears the unhurried imprint of his pinnacle works with Ismail Merchant; The Remains of the Day, A Room with a View and especially 1987's Maurice, a landmark of gay cinema.

Thirty years later, post-Brokeback Mountain, Call Me By Your Name is afforded more daring in its relationship between 17-year-old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer), 24, who's interning for Elio's professor father (Michael Stuhlbarg), documenting artifacts. Elio is bright, multilingual, a talented musician and his father's match in linguistic riddles.

His relationship with Oliver begins conflicted, a stranger bestowed the teen's bedroom, both American, Jewish and intelligent. Elio gravitates to this lusty intruder, introduces his friends including the one with benefits, Marzia (Esther Garrel). Guadagnino luxuriates in their bonding, the nightclubs and swimming holes, usually with others but eventually alone.

Elio makes the first hesitant moves, which bears mentioning only because the age difference has been questioned in the allegation wakes of Kevin Spacey and Roy Moore. Italy's age of consent then and now is 14. Casting may be a factor of discomfort; neither Chalamet, 21, nor Hammer, 31, look as young or old as they're portraying. There is no predatory nature to Call Me By Your Name, only human nature, at times boldly expressed. Elio's sexual curiosity drives Guadagnino's passion; the teen's experiment with a morning-after peach conveys both.

Praise heaped on Chalamet's performance since Sundance, 2017 made me dubious going in. Nobody can be that good this quick, right? Yes, Chalamet can. His Elio is knowingly gifted, unsheathing talent only when he feels like it. Even so, romance is rough draft stuff at his age. Chalamet is a fairly impassive presence, yet each emotional notes rings clear.

Call Me By Your Name concludes with two remarkable scenes, first at a crucial point in Elio and Oliver's relationship, when the teen's father shares his opinion. Ivory hands Stuhlbarg a soliloquy for which actors would kill, a hyper-literate expression of understanding and candor the son doesn't expect. Neither do we, after too many gay-themed films relying on tension from disapproving parents.

The other scene is practically wordless, just Chalamet in closeup for nearly two minutes, his gaze into a fireplace slowly reflecting what a turning point summer still means and always will. Call it what you want but this movie is an instantly fond memory.","Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest.

Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it.

Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone.

Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touching

Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.

Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?"
,,"Heavy with summer heat yet so light, so lyrical, in its vision of that catch-of-breath space between adolescence and adulthood, Call Me by Your Name is a revelation – a richly evocative reminder of that time of life when cuddles with parents overlap with the nervous, excited baring of body and soul of first love.

Seventeen-year-old Elio Perlman (Chalamet) is on that cusp, and he can feel it. It’s making him scratchy. An only child vacationing with his parents in their villa in northern Italy in 1983, Elio fills the days lazily: swimming, eating, napping, transcribing music (he’s a talented pianist), sometimes bored, sometimes sullen from the displacement of being no longer a kid, but not quite an adult. In other words – a teenager. That displacement turns literal in the opening moments of the film, when Elio must cede his bedroom to Oliver (Hammer), an American grad student come abroad to intern with Elio’s father (Stuhlbarg), an antiquities scholar. “The usurper,” Elio smirkingly nicknames Oliver, in French; one of the film’s seductive qualities – of which there are many, including the luscious scenery – is the way the whole Perlman family slides in and out of languages, English, French, Italian, and dead, the latter in a charmingly eggheaded pas de deux over etymological roots.

That fluidity in language isn’t showing off. Director Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash, I Am Love) and screenwriter James Ivory (adapting from André Aciman’s formative novel) layer such details to enrich and distill the relationships. When Elio switches to English with his French girlfriend, she feels the chill. When the close-knit Perlman trio curls up on a rainy night to read aloud a 17th century romance, it’s a perfect summation of their love of learning, of beauty, of opening up to sensation. And when Elio spies a Star of David on a chain around Oliver’s neck, he finds a point of commonality with the American usurper.

Otherwise, they’re a study in contrasts. The solidly built 24-year-old Oliver is confident and bruisingly athletic; Elio, long and lanky, tends to hang on the outskirts of social situations, testing the waters. The first time Oliver touches him – casually, even fraternally – Elio jolts like he’s been shocked. It’s the first spark.

A love affair is inevitable, but Guadagnino doesn’t skim over Elio’s prolonged longing, which is what makes Call Me by Your Name most potent as a coming-of-age picture, not a mere romance. Their age gap has caused some consternation, especially in this particular cultural moment in which consent is rightfully being chewed over on a public stage. It’s worth noting that the film is set in the more permissive early Eighties, and they’re comfortably within the consent laws of Italy. If that doesn’t check the boxes for you, that’s fine; this isn’t the movie for you. Still, the film doesn’t pretend the age gap doesn’t exist. Oliver’s hesitancy in starting the affair, and the care he takes with Elio, are so crucial to the story. In his best work since his breakout in The Social Network, Hammer physically conveys the transformation of Oliver under Elio’s influence, his body tight with restraint, then loosening to the point of a childlike giddiness.

Guadagnino uses a technique throughout of fixing the camera focus and letting his actors move in and out of it, a stylistic choice that reaches its emotional apex with Hammer, at the end of Oliver’s Italian idyll. No words are spoken, but again there’s that layering of detail: We know enough to know the stakes are higher for Oliver, and the camera's shifts from focused to fuzzy subtly convey how full up with feeling he is. Chalamet – who co-starred in Lady Bird, another coming-of-age picture that would make a toothsome double feature with this one – brings great physicality to his part, too. But it’s his face that’ll stop your heart, especially in two prolonged close-ups set to original songs by Sufjan Stevens, confessional lyrics simpatico with the actor’s open face. As for words? The script gives Stuhlbarg – a character actor who elevates everything he’s in – the monologue of a lifetime, which he delivers sotto voce, all kindness.

And that is perhaps the prevailing note of Call Me by Your Name – of kindness, of tenderness. Be it a besotted lover, a best friend, or devoted parents, they’re all a kind of welcoming committee, nurturing Elio into adult feeling. That includes pain. And it is a gift.","I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams."
,,"This review originally ran as part of our Sundance coverage on January 24, 2017. With Call Me By Your Name now in theaters, we are presenting it again.

There’s a scene near the end of Call Me By Your Name, which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival, where Michael Stuhlbarg’s character delivers some of the most touching and heartfelt advice to his son, Elio (Timothée Chalamet), that I’ve ever seen on a movie screen. It’s the kind of scene that stops a viewer dead in his or her tracks because we know we’re watching something so special. Then we can’t help but think how many lives wouldn’t have been damaged if everyone had a parent this empathetic and wise. (I’ll come back to this.)

Armie Hammer’s breakout role came by playing the Winklevoss twins in 2010’s now-classic The Social Network. (And it is crazy that movie is now pushing seven years old.) And he played the roles perfectly as brash, imposing and being able to deliver a cocky one-liner. But then Hollywood couldn’t quite figure out what to do with him.

His follow-up was as Clyde Tolson in Clint Eastwood’s J. Edgar, a role and movie that looked much more interesting on paper than the drab result that Eastwood delivered. The Lone Ranger flopped at the box office, but this wasn’t Hammer’s fault – that movie is impossibly weird and strangely violent in comparison to how it was marketed and has already been reassessed as something unique and unusual in today’s blockbuster landscape. But even though Hammer might have those leading man, blockbuster movie looks, that’s not really where his talents lie.

(Strangely, one of my favorite performances from Hammer came when he played himself in the Entourage movie, of all things. This is not an actor who’s afraid to make fun of himself.)

The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is underrated (I like this movie quite a bit), but I’m not convinced Hammer sporting a thick Russian accent is the best use of his talents. And in Nocturnal Animals, he’s the dickish, rich cheating husband that I was afraid Hammer was about to be typecast as forever.

Finally, finally, director Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash) realized a way to use Hammer’s talents appropriately in Call Me By Your Name.

Hammer plays Oliver, an academic who is living with the Perlman family in Northern Italy circa 1983. Oliver is tall, handsome, seemingly confident, charming and sometimes a little arrogant. (A running joke in the film is when Oliver leaves a conversation he will just say “later” and takes off.) Elio soon finds himself intrigued by Oliver, and slowly that intrigue turns into something else that Elio is confused by, yet he can’t help himself from taking action.

There’s a beautiful scene when Elio tells Oliver about his feelings, staged around a small circular World War I memorial as the two keep getting further and further away from each other, than meeting on the other side. Oliver has feelings for Elio as well, but cautions that nothing can happen and advises Elio to just forget this was ever brought up and to continue on like nothing has ever happened.

Of course, that doesn’t last long. It starts with some innocent kissing in a field, then soon becomes scheduled rendezvous in remote locations for fear of getting caught by Elio’s parents (which would be devastating for both Elio and Oliver). Both actors are wonderful, but was Hammer does here is majestic. He could easily come off as the older creep, but that doesn’t happen. Hammer’s performance is loving and respectful and tender. He’s not taking advantage of Elio – Oliver genuinely has feelings for him – but is also deeply concerned this might be too much for the young man. The way this is all handled is touching and beautiful.

(I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention another recurring joke: Oliver’s dancing. Oh, he’s a big fan of the Psychedelic Furs’ “Love My Way” and breaks into maybe the funniest little ‘80s dance I’ve ever seen, mostly due to watching the impossibly tall Hammer in his short ‘80s shorts breaking into the lamest of dances– but yet he sells it with such gumption, if I saw this happening in real life it would be impossible not to just join in with him.)

At the beginning of this piece I mentioned Michael Stuhlbarg’s advice to Elio. I am not a parent, but I feel like I might make a better parent someday after watching this. Maybe it should be required viewing for new parents. Without giving too much away, it’s a master class in empathy in a situation where saying the wrong thing at this moment could damage Elio forever. It’s a statement on what we do to ourselves as we get older to protect ourselves emotionally, but in return slowly losing the passion that made us feel – losing the emotions that made us human and instead of burying those emotions, we should cherish them. It’s something only an older person can say to a younger person, and maybe something only the older person can even understand. Call Me By Your Name is a triumph of humanity.","I found this film rather emotionally unengaging. I was very aware that the characters were acting and that I was being manipulated. This film felt smug and self-congratulatory. I thought Armie Hammer was too old for the part. I didn't like the way in which the girlfriends were reduced to bit parts and foils with no real existence of their own. Ditto the housekeeper.

I loved Moonlight and one of my all time favorite films is Brokeback Mountain so gay love is no barrier at all for me. This film verged on pretentious."
,,"Now that one of the dullest and least rewarding years in the history of motion pictures is finally dragging its butt to a welcome end, it is clear they saved the best for last. The Post, Steven Spielberg’s relevant and riveting chronicle of Kay Graham’s brilliant reign as publisher of the Washington Post, Lady Bird, the fresh and original coming-of-age film about Greta Gerwig’s formative years as a restless California high-school outsider struggling to find her own identity in the shadow of an overpowering mother, and a galvanizing performance by Annette Bening in Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool, about the final, tragic days of faded Oscar winner Gloria Grahame, are three late must-sees. They are joined by one of the most gorgeously shot, intelligently written, and sensitively acted and directed films I’ve ever seen—a rhapsodic and heartbreaking love story about a summer idyll that changes the lives of a 17-year-old boy and a 24-year-old graduate student in Northern Italy. Riding in on the crest of unanimous raves from film festivals throughout the world, Call Me By Your Name is a masterpiece of subtle emotions, intense sensuality and breathtaking beauty.

Despite an awkward, hard-to-explain title, Call Me By Your Name, exquisitely written by James Ivory and elegantly directed by Luca Guadagnino from the leisurely autobiographical novel by Andre Aciman, is set in 1983 in a lush, sunny villa in Tuscany inhabited by a renowned multi-lingual American archeology professor, his warm and worldly wife and their teenage son Elio. Every summer they invite a promising American college student with an eager mind to spend six weeks assisting the professor in his research. This summer it’s a ravishingly handsome scholar named Oliver (Armie Hammer) who charms everyone at the palazzo with his impressive knowledge, poise, humor and enthusiasm. Everyone except Elio (a breakthrough performance by Timothée Chalamet) who resents relinquishing his room to a stranger as well as his father’s instant fondness for Oliver. While the visitor goes about making a strong impression digging for underwater artifacts in Lake Garda, Elio is reserved but intrigued by his father’s good-looking, brainy American intern. Oliver is not only movie-star handsome enough to attract all the local girls, but he seems to excel at everything—history, sports, disco dancing, and literature.

As the summer wears on, Elio becomes more aware of his growing sexual confusion. He’s had some experiences with girls, but nothing is as fulfilling as being with Oliver. During the day, they ride bikes, explore the Italian sights, taste the local customs. For relaxation, they read 16th century French romance novels, swim, enjoy al fresco meals prepared by the family cook enhanced by fresh, ripe apricots from the orchard, and bask in the sun wearing tight shorts and swim trunks. If you have even a slight craving for the Italian summertime, you’ll want to call your travel agent and book a flight before sundown.

The fact that they’re all Jewish is beside the point (and given Armie Hammer’s blond hair and blue eyes, not totally persuasive, despite the gold Star of David chain around his neck he flashes every time he shows his sun-tanned chest) but it does serve as a worthy ice breaker in the developing attraction before Oliver and Elio become lovers. “I come from a small town in New England,” says Oliver. “So I know how it feels to be an outside Jew.” The real heart-tugging element is the way the two boys allow themselves, however reluctantly, to get close enough for love: Elio is desperate for affection in his alienated confusion and ready to leap like a puppy into the arms of someone he trusts, Oliver is aware of his carnal knowledge but too reserved to make a move. The ecstasy in the eventual sex scenes is passionate but discreet, the anguish in saying goodbye is unbearably universal, and the conclusion features a wise and deeply tender-hearted speech by Elio’s father (a titanic but understated performance by Michael Stuhlbarg) that cannot fail to move anyone who has ever longed for an act of parental guidance that rarely comes and is never self-evident.

The direction by Luca Guadagnino (A Bigger Splash, I Am Love) is reminiscent of Bertolucci’s sensitivity at its best, the fabulous cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom rapturously captures the rich work of art that is Italy in summer, and the actors are to die for. For Armie Hammer, who usually excels playing macho action heroes, the seductive role of Oliver is a bold departure that comes as both a surprise and a challenge. He meets the task with both skill and nuance. And Timothée Chalamet is a penultimate counterpart, holding his corner of the screen in every scene. The entire finale holds the camera on his face for what seems like an eternity as the tears appear, fade away and translate feelings into beguiling expressions that stay with you long after the film ends. What a career this young man has ahead of him, and how exhilarating it will be to see what he does next.","No story line. Can't help but wonder how many people would be writing ""Perfection"" if it was just a boring hetro couple? Cinematography and scoring only redeeming features + old mans speech at the end. Can't believe I just wasted 2.5hrs of my life."
,,"In a week when many of us will take dutiful trips to visit family, consider a two-hour vacation: “Call Me By Your Name” is a dreamscape of sunshine, kindness, sensuality and music. Plus, leafy orchards, al fresco dinner parties, charming Italian town squares — and the agony and ecstasy of first love.

Based on the novel by André Aciman, the film is set in 1983 in northern Italy. Graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) is spending a summer residency studying Greco-Roman antiquities at the home of a professor (Michael Stuhlbarg), his wife (Amira Casar) and their 17-year-old son, Elio (Timothée Chalamet). Their villa is academic shabby-chic, with art and books on every surface, doors banging and window sills peeling, and even an old-fashioned dinner bell.

Oliver is the archetypal American, cocky and athletic; the strapping Hammer is perfect for the part. Elio, slighter and more introverted, is a skilled pianist who initially rolls his eyes at their brash houseguest — “the usurper,” he mutters to his girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel) as Oliver is given Elio’s bedroom — but can’t hide a growing fascination. The professor and Oliver’s work with ancient statues is slyly juxtaposed with the lithe, near-constantly shirtless young men’s bodies, subconsciously posing for one another on the lawn, by the pool and through the door adjoining their bedrooms. Chalamet is a virtuoso of subtle expression; his face flits through a whirlwind of emotions every time Oliver’s nearby, masked by a desperate attempt to play it cool. Despite their seven-year age difference, the two are well-matched intellectually, and at times Elio seems the more urbane, casually shifting between English, French and Italian. When they finally touch, under Oliver’s guise of “just bros” athleticism, the sensuality in the air spikes off the charts. One particular scene that’s gained some advance notoriety involves masturbation and a peach; it’s juicy in every way, a gently kinky ode to Elio’s blossoming sexuality.

Director Luca Guadagnino (“I Am Love”) filmed in Crema, the Italian town he lives in, and you can feel his love for the place: The joy of plunging into an icy pond on a hot day, stopping at a random country house to ask for a glass of water, old men playing cards in the local bar. It’s all set to a rapturous, wide-ranging soundtrack: classical piano, the Psychedelic Furs, bittersweet new songs from Sufjan Stevens.

Stuhlbarg and Casar are sort of fantasy Euro parents: Affectionate and smart, they’re close enough to their son that he’ll ask them for girlfriend advice, but wise enough to sit back and watch his relationship with Oliver develop. For all the transcendent moments between the lovers — and the actors truly have a smoldering chemistry — the most indelible scene may be Stuhlbarg’s speech to his son about savoring the joy and grief of love.","This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you feel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very best out of his actors: Armie Hammer's performance shows unprecedented depth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting, this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least."
,,"The new film by Luca Guadagnino, “Call Me by Your Name,” begins in the summer of 1983, in a place so enchanted, with its bright green gardens, that it belongs in a fairy tale. The location, the opening credits tell us, is “Somewhere in Northern Italy.” Such vagueness is deliberate: the point of a paradise is that it could exist anywhere but that, once you reach the place, it brims with details so precise in their intensity that you never forget them. Thus it is that a young American named Oliver (Armie Hammer) arrives, dopey with jet lag, at the house of Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his Italian wife, Annella (Amira Casar), whose custom is to spend their summers there and also to return for Hanukkah. (Like them, Oliver is Jewish; a closeup shows a Star of David hanging from a chain around his neck.) The Professor, an American expert in classical archeology, requires an annual assistant, and Oliver is this year’s choice. “We’ll have to put up with him for six long weeks,” Annella says, with a sigh. Not long enough, as it turns out. You can pack a whole lifetime into six weeks.

The first words of the film are “The usurper.” They are uttered by the Perlmans’ only child—their son, Elio (Timothée Chalamet), who is seventeen. He stands at an upstairs window with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel) and watches Oliver below, fearful that the American may break the reigning peace. The Professor is more welcoming, and he proposes a kind of free trade, both spatial and emotional, that will resound throughout. “Our home is your home,” he says to Oliver. “My room is your room,” Elio adds, a few seconds later, like an echo. He has moved into the adjoining room for the duration of Oliver’s stay, and they must share a bathroom. The sharing will deepen, from handshakes to confidences, and from cigarettes to kisses and other mouthly charms, concluding in the most profound exchange of all, whispered from a few inches’ distance and proclaimed in the title of the movie.

“Call Me by Your Name” is, among other things, an exercise in polyglottery, and Elio chats to his parents and friends in an easy blend of English, French, and Italian, sometimes sliding between tongues in the course of a single conversation. (Who would guess that a household, no less than a city, can be a melting pot?) His father and Oliver enjoy a clash of wits about the twisted root of the word “apricot,” tracing it through Arabic, Latin, and Greek, and mentioning that one branch leads to the word “precocious”—a nod to Elio, who listens to them with half a smile. He is a prodigy, voraciously bookish, who plays Bach al fresco on the guitar and then inside on the piano, in the manner of Liszt and of Busoni, with Oliver standing in the background, contrapposto, with the elegant tilt of a statue, drinking in the sound and the skill. “Is there anything you don’t know?” he asks, after Elio has told him about an obscure, bloody battle of the First World War.

Prodigies can be a pain, onscreen and off, and Elio—fevered with boyish uncertainties and thrills, though no longer a boy, and already rich in adult accomplishments, yet barely a man—should be an impossible role. Somehow, as if by magic, Chalamet makes it work, and you can’t imagine how the film could breathe without him. His expression is sharp and inquisitive, but cream-pale and woundable, too, and saved from solemnity by the grace of good humor; when Oliver says that he has to take care of some business, Elio retorts by impersonating him to his face. Chalamet is quite something, but Hammer is a match for him, as he needs to be, if the characters’ passions are to be believed. Elio is taken aback, at the start, by Oliver’s swagger—the hesitant youth, steeped in Europe, confronted with can-do American chops. Hammer doesn’t strut, but his every action, be it dismounting a bicycle, draining a glass of juice (apricot, of course), slinging a backpack over his shoulder, rolling sideways into a pool, or demolishing a boiled egg at breakfast until it’s a welter of spilled yolk suggests a person almost aggressively at home in his own body, and thus in the larger world. Hence the abrupt note that he sends to Elio: “Grow up. See you at midnight.”","Some very strange scores going on with IMDb at the moment. Four of us went to see this yesterday, two were gay and the other two very liberal lefties, so our distaste was not for reasons I can imagine other people would hate this film.

Three of us found this incredibly slow, far too long and were aching for it to finish.

They even managed to totally misjudge when to end the film. The one truly moving moment was a conversation with father and son that was powerful and brilliant, but they had to carry the film on even longer with yet more slow and inconsequential scenes. Very dull indeed."
,,"In Call Me by Your Name, the gifted young American actor Timothée Chalamet plays Elio, a 17-year-old who spends summers with his academic parents in their airy, rustic villa in Crema in northern Italy. In early scenes, the skinny, long-waisted Elio seems vaguely uncomfortable in his body, as if uncertain what to do with it apart from the de rigueur canoodling with teenage girls who swim with him in nearby lakes and ponds. It’s only when he stares from his bedroom window at the arrival of this year’s summer guest — a young scholar who’ll spend six weeks reading, writing, and working with the professor — that Elio seems to come out of his own head. The 24-year-old visitor, Oliver (Armie Hammer), has an easy, almost arrogant physicality. He’s broad-shouldered, slim-hipped, absurdly handsome. But he’s hard to read. Oliver gives the shirtless Elio a quick shoulder massage and then heads off to play volleyball. Was it innocent or a come-on? Whichever, Oliver’s touch lingers. Elio sneaks into Oliver’s room and sticks his nose into a pair of discarded bathing trunks, inhaling sharply. He puts them on his head. He’s in heaven.

Call Me by Your Name takes place in summer, 1983. It has the feel of something recollected in tranquility, but the eroticism is startlingly immediate. The faithful adaptation of André Aciman’s novel is by James Ivory, but the movie has a different feel than Ivory’s own formal, somewhat stiff work. The Italian director Luca Guadagnino creates a mood of free-floating sexual longing. Oliver never wears long pants, only short shorts or swim trunks, and young men are always doffing their shirts and jumping into sparkling water or riding on bicycles along dirt roads. The flesh tones stand out against the villa’s pale whites and yellow walls — more tactile but on a continuum with the sculptures and oil paintings by men with similar longings centuries ago. Call Me by Your Name is hardly the first film set in Italy to juxtapose youth and beauty and fleeting seasons with ancient buildings and ruins. But I can’t recall such a continuum between the ephemeral and the enduring.

I also can’t remember a filmmaker who has captured the essence of midsummer this way, lazy but so vivid that every sound registers. Sound floats in through windows — of insects and birds but mostly wind. The presence of Nature can be felt in every one of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom’s frames. It’s reflected in the bodies of the characters. Oliver is hard for Elio — and us — to read. Is he toying with the teenager? Or is something stirring in him, too? In this atmosphere, how can something not be stirring? There’s friction in the uncertainty, heightened when Oliver dances provocatively with Elio’s kinda-sorta girlfriend. The minutes go by and then we’re into the film’s second hour with everything maddeningly —but thrillingly — undefined.

The love scenes between Elio and Oliver aren’t explicit — they only feel as if they are. The title is said in a moment of passion. It’s Oliver’s fervent desire to dissolve his self, to become one with Elio. I should point out that Armie Hammer doesn’t look 24 — more like 29, which he was during filming, and that changes the dynamic. Make of that what you will (17 was above the age of legal consent in Italy), but it’s Elio who finally pushes Oliver over the brink — who calls the question.

Michael Stuhlbarg plays Elio’s father, an anthropology professor who gazes intently at his son, seems to know what’s happening — and doesn’t interfere. He and Elio have a revelatory conversation near the end, but it’s the very last shot that stays in mind, all but dissolving the boundary between viewer and actor. Everything in Call Me by Your Name registers momentously, from the scene that definitively raises the question, “Do I dare to eat a peach?” to the ’80s dance numbers to the yearning Sufjan Stevens song over the stunning credits. Chalamet gives the performance of the year. By any name, this is a masterpiece.","If you have ever stumbled upon an Insta story of a brunch table with a polo shirt lightly hanged on the brim of the chair, a visibly used Penguin edition of a Thomas Mann roman and a moleskin notebook full of pretentious calligraphy, all serving as props, welcome to Guadanino's world. The characters are moving advertisements of Polo and Lacoste who carry books they have never read as medals, cite snippets of poets they never got and surround themselves in a world of art to boost their shallow egos. Every character of this film is a poor copy of a real life personality: see the professor who is a more handsome, gay friendly version of Umberto Eco. Under all this stylization lies nothing. All the spontaneous action feels terribly staged and you can taste a fear in the air. The fear that if an actor misses one step of this mind numbing choreography, the whole world will crumble. Don't ask me to think highly of a director who dedicates a whole scene to advertise espresso."
,,"“If only you knew how little I knew about the things that matter,” drawls Elio (Timothée Chalamet) halfway through Call Me By Your Name. Seventeen, quietly creative, loudly bored, he’s talking to the handsome grad student who’s spending the summer of ’83 at his parents’ Italy home. It’s the culmination of weeks of furtive flirtation. “What things?” asks the object of his affection. “You know what things,” murmurs Elio. Indeed, we do.

In a film that floats between coming-of-age ennui and heart-stopping moments of beauty, this is the first time Elio talks openly about his feelings. Up until this point, Luca Guadagnino’s alluring adaptation of André Aciman’s 2007 novel luxuriates in ambiguity. Between bright cups of apricot juice and tins of Illy coffee, the story unspools of Elio’s crush on 24-year-old grad student Oliver (Armie Hammer), an all-American jock in tiny shorts whose breezy geniality aggravates as much as it allures.

  As the duo embark on winding country bike rides and circle each other in sun-dappled courtyards, Chalamet and Hammer cast a beguiling spell. In a giant step up from playing Matthew McConaughey’s son in Interstellar, Chalamet is remarkable, etching an unshowy portrait of a boy on the cusp of adulthood; constantly pretending, seemingly unsure how to behave. Chalamet speaks fluent English, Italian and French, plays the piano and, in the film’s boldest holdover from Aciman’s novel, fearlessly enacts an unforgettable moment with a peach.

Hammer, meanwhile, is a revelation. Departing each scene with a maddening “later”, he’s a million miles from big-budget blow-outs such as The Lone Ranger and The Man From U.N.C.L.E.. Pivotally, he’s unafraid of allowing Oliver to be unlikeable, lending this luminously optimistic film an edge that kills sentimentality in its tracks. Guadagnino is a master of the slow build but, unlike the mounting hysteria of I Am Love and the shock rug-pulls of A Bigger Splash, this feels more urgently personal, capturing the pleasures and pains of youth with bracing sensitivity. When Elio talks of “things that matter” it’s relatable no matter your gender or orientation. CMBYN finds a neat balance between heart and art (something Guadagnino has struggled with), whether it’s referencing Heraclitus or playing on Hellenic male relationships.

Of course, there are also Ray-Bans and ‘Love My Way’ by The Psychedelic Furs; the magic of Guadagnino’s film is in its deceptively freewheeling style. In its final moments, CMBYN offers a powerfully emotional full stop; those things that matter have rarely been more arrestingly captured. ","The scene which I found the most moving is when the girl Marzia, in a beautiful red dress, arrives on her bike in the hope to meet Elio again, and is so much disappointed with his dismissal of her. After four days not having contacted her, after two lovemakings, he rejects her point blank. He has not even taken the initiative to let her know that he is not interested in her anymore. The look of grief on her beautiful face is heartrendering.

And that is my main critic of the two characters of the movie: they are so insensitive to other people's feelings, and as such there is no identification of the viewer with them, gay or straight. If you have found out that you like boys more than girls, why giving girls hope that you will be her passionate lover. If anyone is a traitor in this movie, it is Elio, because of making love to Marzia, knowing he can not give her what she is prepared to give him, and Oliver, when he anounces that he is going to marry, and in 1983, that could only be to a girl.

Another flaw is in the parents: -do you think mother knows-, asked Elio his father (about his lovemaking with Oliver). I don't think so- is the answer. Of course she knows! Every mother knows intuitively that her son is gay, which is proved when she tries to console him on the way back from the station. Apperently the two parents don't talk to each other about their son, between smoking there cigarettes.

And that is my last point: why the cigarettes? In 1983 the negative effect of smoking on health was already widely known, and there you are, in beautiful Italy, a nice home with books, music, erudite guests, gardens and orchards; then follows a moving speech of the father to his gay son that he will be always there for him, while in fact after another ten years of smoking he will only be there for the oncologist or the cardiac care unit."
Darkest Hour,Oscar,"Winston Churchill lived a life that was long and “not … entirely uneventful,” as he once put it, and so it’s only fitting that he should be the subject of movies. Hence, across the veil of years, we have seen tall Churchills, obese Churchills, sloppy Churchills, gross Churchills and scowling bulldog Churchills, and yet not one movie or TV Churchill has come close to giving us the man in full, both in look and spirit, until Gary Oldman in “Darkest Hour.”

For viewers interested in history, the fascination of this performance — the sense of actually seeing events we have only imagined — has no comparison in impact besides that of Daniel Day-Lewis in “Lincoln.” There he is — not tall, not especially fat. There he is, not just the voice, but the gestures, which combined an older man’s stiffness with a boy’s enthusiasm and energy.

Oldman’s main accomplishment, however, is in the way he captures the many nuances of Churchill’s demeanor and personality. There was something rather cute about Churchill, something lovable about him, which is not to say that Oldman goes around trying to be cute and lovable. Rather, he is irascible and impossible and sentimental and romantic and frustrated. But in all ways, this Churchill is human and authentic, and fighting alone to save his country and the world from Nazi barbarism.

Directed by Joe Wright, who visited this era to memorable effect in “Atonement,” “Darkest Hour” deals with the brief span between Churchill’s appointment as prime minister and the fall of France in World War II. It was the period in which Britain had to decide whether to fight on alone or to pursue some kind of negotiated peace on Adolf Hitler’s terms. In Churchill, Britain had a fighting prime minister, but his government was split on the subject, and there loomed a real possibility that Churchill might swiftly be replaced.

This is a story that is rarely told, and when told, rarely emphasized. Most Americans are familiar with the period that followed, Britain’s “finest hour,” in which the nation faced Hitler alone for a full year, resisting submarine attack and aerial bombardment. “Darkest Hour” tells the story that preceded it, in which an outgunned, peace-loving nation looked into the abyss and found the will to risk everything.

Churchill was the key to that channeling of the national will. But what’s especially effective about the film, and about Anthony McCarten’s screenplay, is that we get to see that this was no obvious decision. King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) looks upon Churchill as a dangerous old romantic, and what’s more, we understand, through Oldman’s performance, why anyone might feel that way. The movie puts very good arguments for peace — essentially surrender — into the mouth of Lord Halifax. If we know anything about history, of course, we know that Halifax was dangerously, horribly wrong, but Stephen Dillane, who plays Halifax, sounds like the voice of reason compared with Churchill, who was, after all, emotional and quixotic and drank almost enough liquor every day to drown a horse.

So, as we watch, we agree with Churchill because we know how things turned out. But the movie makes us wonder: Would we agree if we were actually in that room? As was the case with Lincoln, all the idiosyncrasies that make Churchill human and beloved in retrospect made him a bit suspect in his own time.

Wright, whose long, unbroken shot of Dunkirk in “Atonement” was breathtaking, finds moments to insert visual flair into a movie that’s mostly about a man going from room to room, either arguing with people or trying to buck them up. In one scene, Wright shows a British officer in France as seen from above, then moves the camera through the roof and slowly upwards, high into the sky, until we arrive upon the sight of a German bomber, dropping its payload.

Though “Darkest Hour” is about grand strategy and policy, much of it is about the personal. Lily James plays one of Churchill’s secretaries and effortlessly embodies the freshness of a new generation and Churchill’s responsibility to the future. We see Churchill in dark moments of doubt, coping with a degree of stress we can hardly imagine. He takes strength in the common people he meets and especially in the advice of his wife, Clementine, rightly played by Kristin Scott Thomas as indulgent yet sensible — a stern corrector, when necessary. “Darkest Hour” is a persuasive window into history, and so arresting in its portrait of one of the 20th century’s most important leaders that every minute of it is absorbing. It runs for two hours, and its only flaw is that it doesn’t go on for six or seven more. I could have easily watched Oldman as Churchill go through the Battle of Britain and past it, all the way up to his speech before a joint session of Congress, a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Some movies are just so good that they make you feel grateful to the people that made them. “Darkest Hour” is one of those movies.","At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.

Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.

The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!

The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film."
,,"I’ve been trying to think when there was a historical drama I found as electrifying as Joe Wright’s “Darkest Hour.” It may have been Steven Spielberg’s “Munich,” which topped my 10-best list a dozen years ago. They are very different films, of course, and it could be that Wright’s boasts stellar accomplishments in more departments. While Gary Oldman’s phenomenal work as Winston Churchill had been heralded in advance, it is astonishingly equaled by the film’s achievements in direction, screenwriting, score and cinematography. It’s a strange irony that the same patch of British history—a few days in the spring of 1940—has been treated in two big, Oscar-aimed 2017 movies (and even plays a role in a third film from earlier this year, “Their Finest”). In various ways, Wright’s film and Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” are instructive companion pieces, with different aims that effectively orient them toward different audiences. “Dunkirk” imagines the evacuation of British troops under the onslaught of Nazi forces in a way that puts sensation over sense; it says nothing of the event’s historical context or import. Indeed, it could have been made with all action and no words, where “Darkest Hour” is all about words, words-as-action and this seminal event’s meaning to our world. It asks you to engage intellectually, not just viscerally.

But if it’s a history lesson, it’s one that plays like a tightly wound, pulse-pounding thriller. And why not: the decisions it depicts may have determined the fate of the world. The action takes place from May 8 to June 4, 1940 (the film regularly slams the dates at us in big block letters), and is framed by two important addresses in the House of Commons, the “Norway Debate” and Churchill’s rousing, epochal “We shall fight them on the beaches” speech. In between, Churchill becomes Prime Minister, because he’s the only member of his party acceptable to the opposition, and then rallies the country to fight Hitler when other politicians want to strike a deal with him.

Understanding the importance of this story’s events is not terribly easy now because it’s difficult to look at the world of 1940 as people did then. The Germans may have subjugated several European countries, but the coming slaughter of the continent’s Jews was still unsuspected, and Hitler was widely seen as a very effective authoritarian ruler (a quality that some non-Germans beset with dithering democrats frankly admired) rather than a murderous madman. Churchill’s virtue in this moment was to see the truth more clearly than others did, and to understand both the absolute necessity and the arduous difficulty of fighting the Nazi regime to the death.The film’s title is entirely accurate. With the Germans threatening to obliterate Britain’s army prior to the Dunkirk evacuation (which is alluded to rather than shown here), and Churchill soon to hear Franklin Roosevelt decline to help the Brits due to the anti-interventionist sentiment in Congress, the United Kingdom was at a very dark and lonely place indeed. It’s no wonder that Churchill’s main opponents in this drama, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane), encouraged having Mussolini negotiate a deal with Hitler that might have spared Britain from invasion and potential mass slaughter. Even King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), before being won over to Churchill’s viewpoint, was amenable to dealing with the devil.

The Winston Churchill we see here is no cartoon hero or plaster saint. As the recent, wretched “Churchill” (which was as roundly denounced by historians and Churchill experts as “Darkest Hour” has been praised) did, Wright’s film notes the dark stain on the leader’s public career that the battle of Gallipoli in World War I represented, but doesn’t make it a psychological millstone. “Darkest Hour” likewise frequently shows us its protagonist from the viewpoints of his acerbic though supportive wife, Clemmie (the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas), and his young, endlessly put-upon secretary, Elizabeth (Lily James). Yet the freshness of this film’s portrayal begins with the dramatic sharpness and historical intelligence of Anthony McCarten’s script, which gives us a Churchill who is drawn into dynamic action by the looming shadow of Hitler’s evil.

After charting the perilous political waters, he must navigate to gain the support of his war cabinet, the film climaxes with a sublime invention: a scene in which Churchill, on the way to Parliament, bounds out of his traffic-bound limousine, hops on the Underground and listens to a car full of average Londoners voice their support for his war aims. As corny as this may sound, it’s an entirely appropriate way of registering the kind of popular backing, even affection, that Churchill enjoyed during wartime (he was voted out of office as soon as the war ended), and it works in part due to the spunky charm and thoroughgoing excellence of Gary Oldman’s performance, which deserves every award it will inevitably win.A kindred excellence characterizes the striking collaboration between Joe Wright and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who together give the film a very nuanced and engaging balance of light and shadow, eloquent movement and meditative stasis. For my money, Delbonnel’s work surpasses even “Dunkirk” to emerge as the best cinematography of the year so far. Wright’s team also benefits from the understated lyricism of Dario Marianelli’s score.

The events leading up to the charged drama we see in “Darkest Hour” have not been totally forgotten, of course. The name of Neville Chamberlain, Churchill’s predecessor, will forever be associated with the term “appeasement,” which these days hardliners use at every opportunity to denounce attempts to negotiate with objectionable regimes and rulers. But Wright’s film indirectly makes the point that not every tinpot dictator is a Hitler nor is every posturing, hawkish politician a Churchill. Certain times and men are indeed exceptional, which is why a movie like “Darkest Hour” itself stands apart from more routine historical dramas.","As a film this is quite good; it's not dull, the performances are good, the production design is excellent, the script is a professional piece of work and even Oldman's make-up is not too distracting.

However, something is not right. If most people get their history from movies, this is concerning. It's obvious that actual events occurred with real people and what they did and said but in a movie this gets pasteurized into what smart people believe will be more thrilling, more sympathetic, more emotional. That process necessarily alters things into something that is even anachronistically rendered and therefore not in the record.

This defect occurs frequently in this movie , so it's not history but myth making. A good example is Churchill's dive into the Underground to meet the common person to steel his resolve. Now Churchill had a mixed view of the average voter, and he was a patrician, but even that aside, he did not need to take a Tube train survey to gauge opinion.

This scene is poached from Shakespeare's Henry V where the king goes among his soldiers the night before battle to hear them and take courage from their strength. Steal from the best is a good policy, but it's not history. It's Shakespearean history and that trades effect for accuracy too.

The audience is given this scene to present Churchill as an instrument of democracy; he's acting for what the people want, therefore he's doing the right thing. It's called pandering.

Well, it is just a movie."
,,"A little less than three weeks from the publication of this review John Lithgow is expected to win an Emmy for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in the Netflix series “The Crown.” Earlier this year Brian Cox earned positive notices for his own interpretation of the legendary British Prime Minister in the appropriately titled “Churchill.” In fact, Churchill appears in some form or another a few times a year and talents such as Brendan Gleeson, Albert Finney, Bob Hoskins, John Houseman and Richard Burton have tried to capture the once in a lifetime charisma of this historical figure on the big or small screen. No disrespect to those men’s talents, but all their work will soon be secondary to Gary Oldman’s transformative performance in Joe Wright’s new drama “Darkest Hour” which premiered at the 2017 Telluride Film Festival on Friday.

What makes Oldman’s work here so impressive is the almost invisible emotional arc he is able to fashion as Anthony McCarten’s screenplay carefully unfolds.  It’s 1940 and Britain is losing the battle to stop Hitler’s hostile annexation of Europe. With Nazis perilously close to invading England, the current PM and peace-advocate Neville Chamberlin (Ronald Pickup) loses the confidence of Parliament and is forced to resign. Despite being unpopular within his own party, Churchill, a longtime UK political figure, somehow gets his shot at leading the nation at its most perilous point because of the support of the opposition party. That being said King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn, fantastic) doesn’t trust him and his party’s original choice to replace Chamberlin, Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane, slightly one note but effective), is out to undermine him at every turn. Historians will tell you Churchill certainly was guilty of making initial mistakes when he took power and Wright and McCarten smartly use those facts to their advantage. The film chronicles Churchill’s initial belief in keeping Germany’s advances as quiet as possible in order to avoid panicking the British people, but that lie only angers his political rivals. Moreover, by stacking his War Cabinet with said political rivals creates an unruly mechanism (thanks mostly to Halifax) in which to carry out military operations and strategy. It’s when his idea to recruit civilian ships to help rescue the 300,000 stranded troops at Dunkirk comes to fruition that he begins to see a road to bring not only the nation’s warring political factions, but its people together (and yes, in many ways the film is a nice historical companion to Christopher Nolan’s own epic).

In the wrong hands though “Darkest Hour” could have been a staid affair played out cinematically in a classic, but increasingly familiar style. Wright, who has had a visionary eye since his first film, “Pride and Prejudice,” creates some inspired staging and uses a bird’s eye perspective motif multiple times.  That keeps the political back and forth that takes place in underground bunkers and familiar period drawing rooms from turning the picture into a well acted slog. Granted, there are times when you wish McCarten had found a way to condense more of the story, but Wright is keenly aware of history’s shortcomings and keeps the pace moving as quickly as he can. The filmmaker also collaborates with Oldman to bring some unexpectedly emotional moments to the proceedings.

In one particular sequence, and much to the surprise of the Underground’s regular riders, Churchill decides to take the train to Parliament for the first time.  Churchill quizzes the people he meets on whether the country should negotiate a peace treaty or fight for control of their island. As each rider voices their anger that anyone would succumb to Hitler, a young girl punctuates their feelings saying they should fight and it brings the PM to tears. What could have seemed schmaltzy instead is inspiring and if it can stir the feelings of residents on this side of the Atlantic, the significance to British viewers should increase one hundred fold.

Another significant scene finds Churchill dictating a speech with his quiet, but loyal typist Elizabeth Layton (Lily James, never better). When he sees a photo on her desk of a British soldier Churchill assumes it’s her beau. Instead, Layton reveals its her brother who was fighting in France and never made it back to the relative safety of Dunkirk. This revelation stops Churchill in his tracks as the human toll of the war begins to truly wear him down. It’s a moving moment that Wright lets breathe to expert effect giving Oldman yet another opportunity to shine.

Some of the director’s success, however, is obviously due to his fine crew. After years of working with Seamus McGarvey the director finds another strong visual collaborator in cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel while production designer Sarah Greenwood finds new ways to bring this familiar WWII era to life. This is the fourth movie Wright and Dario Marianelli have worked on together (Marianelli won an Oscar for “Atonement”) and while it may not be as distinctly memorable as their previous films the Italian composer contributions cannot be discounted.

No matter what McCarten or Wright might have tried “Darkest Hour” wouldn’t hit its soaring highs without Oldman in the title role. What makes this so remarkable is Oldman wore a tremendous amount of special effects makeup to transform into Churchill.  The process turned the somewhat slight actor into the overweight and imposing figure that’s easily recognizable from any photo or archived newsreel. Many actors would have gotten lost under all that foam latex, but Oldman is so possessed you completely forget its even there. And more so, his ability to subtly convey Churchill’s pain, insecurity and, at times, quiet fear under this apparatus is almost unfathomable.

Few would argue that Oldman isn’t one of the finest actors of his generation, but this is a tour de force portrayal that will define his body of work for decades to come. And when you take account those countless portrayals over the years this makes the film and Oldman’s performance something extraordinary. [A-/B+]","At just under 1000 votes so far, I am stunned at the number of ""1"" votes. On the other hand, the 2nd-highest number of votes is for ""10"", so there is very much a love-it-or-hate-it quality to the voters.

It would be helpful if some of the ""1"" voters explained why they hated the movie.

This movie is about British backroom parliamentary politics, in the 1st month of Winston Churchill's prime ministership. With the war going badly, a rearguard of peaceniks is still trying to get a peace deal with Hitler, despite having been pushed out of power.

It certainly worked for me, a political junkie. If you are one too, this is for you. If not, maybe like the ""1"" and ""2"" voters, you might be bored to tears and should stay away."
,,"With all due respect to Christopher Nolan, no filmmaker has captured the evacuation of Dunkirk better than Joe Wright, who evoked the sheer scale of England’s finest hour via a five-minute tracking shot in “Atonement.” Now, with “Darkest Hour,” Wright returns to show the other side of the operation. Set during the crucial early days of Winston Churchill’s first term as prime minister, this talky yet stunningly cinematic history lesson balances the great orator’s public triumphs with more vulnerable private moments of self-doubt, elevating the inner workings of British government into a compelling piece of populist entertainment.

Whereas Nolan’s “Dunkirk” so thrillingly illustrated the military rescue at Dunkirk, all but banishing Churchill to a newspaper article read aloud at the end of the film, “Darkest Hour” spends nearly every scene at the prime minister’s side — except for the first couple, during which Churchill is dramatically absent, represented only by the bowler hat left behind in his empty seat in the House of Commons.

Wright introduces Churchill a few minutes later, sitting in the dark of his own bedroom, illuminated only by the match he strikes to light his signature cigar. The face that appears belongs to Gary Oldman, all but unrecognizable beneath Kazuhiro Tsuji’s jowly prosthetic makeup and thinning white hair. Upon closer examination, the eyes are unmistakably Oldman’s: alert, intense and aggressively intelligent. The resulting performance is unlike anything Oldman has previously delivered, in part because this time, the character is one we presume to know so well from archival footage, photographs and radio recordings. And yet, the master actor rejects mere mimicry, constructing from the ground up a full-bodied and impressively nuanced version of the historical figure.

Beginning on May 9, 1940, and ticking away the days to Operation Dynamo in bold block letters, “Darkest Hour” begins as France and Belgium are on the brink of surrendering to Hitler. Parliament has lost confidence in Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), who has terminal cancer and tenders his resignation directly to King George (Ben Mendelsohn). Churchill wasn’t his party’s first choice, but he was the only conservative of whom the opposition approved, in part because he had flip-flopped between both parties over the previous decade. hat flexibility was one of his greatest assets — or so believes his wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas, a strong force in a few small but impactful scenes) — and the reason he was able to build a coalition government in this time of crisis. And yet, Churchill was also a man of conviction, and the movie paints him as the lone politician willing to defy Hitler and to declare war “at any cost” if necessary, when so many wanted to seek peace — or were otherwise unwilling to repeat the bloodshed of the Great War that had cost the U.K. so dearly just two decades earlier.

Arriving at a moment when screens are virtually saturated with Churchill portrayals — ranging from John Lithgow’s turn on “The Crown” to theatrical offerings starring Brian Cox and Michael Gambon — “Darkest Hour” is by far the most cinematic, this despite Anthony McCarten’s script, so eloquently theatrical that it conceivably could have been performed on a blank stage. Wright is both a virtuoso filmmaker and a natural showman, interpreting the screenplay as no other director could have possibly imagined it. Since his very first feature, 2005’s “Pride & Prejudice,” he has been reinventing the rules of how period pieces ought to be shot, and “Darkest Hour” is no different. Dialing things back from his relatively garish adaptations of “Anna Karenina” and “Pan,” this more elegant film’s style brilliantly marries the classical with the cutting-edge, relying on regular composer Dario Marianelli and his swirling, march-like motifs for much of its energy. Working for the first time with DP Bruno Delbonnel, Wright frames the House of Commons from angles that suggest 18th-century painting, and pushes the contrast to such an extreme that the look — with its deep shadows and near-blinding highlights — recalls black-and-white films of the era. At the same time, he innovates, breaking from the walk-and-talk political-drama template introduced by “The West Wing” (from which “House of Cards” and so many others still borrow) in favor of a more dynamic, omniscient camera, with which he navigates the halls of power.

Apart from a few high-concept overhead views of the front itself (including one especially stunning shot in which bombs erupt on a stretch of terrain that seamlessly fades into the corpse of a fallen soldier), “Darkest Hour” takes place in an entirely different sphere of action, its locations ranging from the bunker-like cabinet war rooms beneath Westminster Palace to Churchill’s own private residence — all impressively recreated without drawing undue attention to the production design. The idea here is that the audience has complete, unrestricted access to Churchill during these critical days, at one point even following him into a private room from which he calls U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose hands are tied by recent neutrality agreements.

Churchill may be prime minister, but his power is blocked by the leaders of both parties, who are scheming to undermine him, lest he agree to talk peace with Italy’s Benito Mussolini. Meanwhile, Churchill has self-confidence issues of his own — and in these he is supported by the young typist (Lily James) to whom he dictates his various letters and speeches. Unfortunately, this particular chapter in history has been so thoroughly dramatized in recent years that many of the finest moments in “Darkest Hours” echo elements from other films. For example, “Churchill” (released earlier this summer) offers the wife and secretary characters meatier roles, and a key scene in which the prime minster goes on the radio to address the nation too closely resembles “The King’s Speech” (although it should be said that Mendelson’s portrayal of George VI improves upon Colin Firth’s in some ways).

Even so, familiarity does nothing to diminish the power of Churchill’s well-known speeches — to the extent that some audience members may find themselves mouthing the words in unison, as James’ character does from the sidelines. And McCarten creates an entirely original, if borderline-corny sequence set in the London Underground, during which Churchill interfaces directly with his constituents, regardless of race or class. His actual policies were far less progressive, but for the sake of this stirring bit of political revisionism, it swells the heart to see Churchill bonding with the black man who finishes his Shakespearean quotation. In actuality, Churchill wrote his own history, and here, Wright and McCarten have re-drafted it even more emphatically in his favor. But Oldman makes him human, and his performance gives us ample room to reevaluate the iconic figure.","It's a one man show about one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and what a show it is. Gary Oldman has been able to be Sid Vicious in ""Sid And Nancy"" with the same outstanding commitment and extraordinary results. Joe Wright, the gifted director of ""Atonement"" presents us with an irresistible version of Churchill through the magic powers of Oldman but sometimes he doesn't seem to trust the power of what he has in his hand. Eccentric cuts in the middle of a famous speech for instance and other stylistic distractions arrive with irritating frequency but that doesn't spoil. too much, the joy and fun of seeing Gary Olman in action. Also interesting to notice, Dunkirk provides a very moving moment for the second time this year."
,,"You could look at Joe Wright’s historical drama “Darkest Hour” as the flip side of Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk.” It tells of the same events, but from a different perspective: Nolan’s film focuses on the thousands of troops famously stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk during World War II; Wright’s takes place in the dim hallways of power in London, where politicians led by Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) debate how to rescue them. (Throw in Lone Scherfig’s “Their Finest,” in which wartime filmmakers make a movie inspired by the Dunkirk incident, and you’d have a pretty great triple feature.) And while “Dunkirk” swoops and dances with time, “Darkest Hour” is a straightforward, day-by-day depiction of world-changing events, told with meticulous simplicity. This Masterpiece Theater-ish approach, however, works just fine. “Darkest Hour” is a handsome, old-fashioned film, filled with stirring music, dusty light and thoughtful performances — with one whopper of a star turn at its core. Oldman, who offscreen looks not a whit like Churchill, is physically transformed here: prosthetics drown his face in jowls; trousers are pulled high over a protruding belly; his walk is heavy and deliberate, leaning forward, hands clasped behind as if in counterbalance. His overstuffed cushion of a voice, complete with indistinguishable mumbles between words, intones both now-famous speeches (“We shall fight on the beaches …”) and more prosaic dialogue. (“How do you manage all this drinking during the day?” someone asks Churchill, whose day begins with breakfast Scotch-and-soda. “Practice,” the prime minister replies.)

Wright surrounds Oldman with masterful supporting players: Kristin Scott Thomas, who gets only enough time to make you wish that her arch Clemmie Churchill had a movie of her own (somebody please make this movie); Lily James as a wide-eyed young secretary to the prime minister; Ben Mendelsohn’s King George VI, struggling with a speech impediment (which Mendelsohn is careful not to overplay) and with events he cannot control. But this is Oldman’s movie, and it’s a pleasure to watch him disappear into Churchill. If the movie occasionally slips into implausibility — there’s a charming scene involving Churchill on the Tube that’s perhaps too charming — it’s easy to forgive. “Darkest Hour” is history made drama; a portrait of a leader both larger than life and utterly human.","I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere."
,,"From the instant he appears, in the flash of a match in an unlit room as he lights his cigar in bed, we forget Gary Oldman is playing a part. He transforms into Winston Churchill, the bulldog face and jowly rumble of a voice immortalized in history, the wordsmith with Shakespeare and Cicero committed to memory — a quip, insult or neatly-turned phrase always on his tongue.

In “Darkest Hour,” Oldman, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten give us the iconic Churchill, and the one his contemporaries and peers will recognize as well — hard-drinking, mercurial, “in love with the sound of his own voice” and sure his soaring rhetoric will be enough, when plainly, at first at least, it wasn’t.

Britain’s “Darkest Hour” came in May and early June of 1940, when the appeasing Conservative government of Neville Chamberlain collapsed, along with France. And the only acceptable alternative for the opposition parties joining a coalition government was the bellicose and often-blundering First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill.

His own party preferred the unctuous Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane), a practical man whose practicality sounded a lot like the appeasement of the unpopular Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). The lisping Halifax (Churchill calls him “Holy Fox,” and not admiringly) was a great favorite of the stammering King George (Ben Mendelsohn), who despised Churchill.

But even his enemies wanted the Goat of Gallipoli (Churchill’s greatest World War I blunder), with a failed Norwegian intervention freshly added to his resume, to take power. Things were so bleak that he was sure to fail, leaving the way open for more reasonable leadership.

Wright (“Atonement,” “Hanna”) and cinematographer Bruno DelBonnel (“Inside Llewyn Davis”) give us a gorgeously literal “Darkest Hour,” showing us the raucous debates of a dimly-lit parliament, a world pre-florescent (or LED) lighting in Buckingham Palace, Churchill’s country estate (Checkers) and the underground bunkers of his war rooms.

The gloom infects Churchill as well, a man who has lived “since the crib” for this moment, who spent the 1930s shouting into the void that Britain needed to prepare to defend itself against global fascism (and communism). Screenwriter McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”) gives us his stumbles, his high-handedness, loopy impulses and drunken, slurred speech, letting all comers name the old man’s shortcomings.

“I wouldn’t let him borrow my bicycle!”

His one champion lives under his roof, the mother of his children, wife Clementine (a steely Kristin Scott Thomas).

“When youth departs, may wisdom prove enough.” The story is more or less seen through the eyes of the mumbling old grump’s new secretary, played by Lily James, as a young and over-matched typist forced to endure tongue-lashings and insults because she comes to recognize the dire straits they’re in. She’s the very embodiment of “Keep Calm and Carry On.”

Oldman lets us see the despair as Churchill pleads with President Roosevelt (David Strathairn, uncredited) over the phone and cajoles the unimpressed, defeatist French. We hear the stumbling thoughts and incoherent sentences that take over as the repeated doses of whisky take hold.

Still, Oldman’s Churchill carries the weight of the world right to his breaking point, while never losing sight of the infamous wit.

“Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!”

And McCarten humanizes that wit by showing the careful deliberations of Churchill dictating, editing and polishing his speeches, “deploying the English language” as a weapon of war.

Oldman is blessed with a better movie than Brian Cox, whose “Churchill” captured the leader as he wavered and meddled with invasion plans, losing his nerve right before D-Day. But Oldman’s performance goes beyond uncanny impersonation and into the realm of inhabiting a man. Watch the playful way he and Mendelsohn exchange formalities when he’s summoned to take control of the government, the sentimentality he gives this patrician blowhard who ruled a country whose working class people he had virtually no connection to. The story overlaps, neatly, with Christopher Nolan’s brilliant “Dunkirk,” the year’s best film. “Darkest Hour” is more a character portrait than a cinematic immersion in a place and time. But thanks to Oldman’s unerring portrayal of a deeply flawed man rising to face a crisis and inspiring a nation to rise with him, it’s an equally worthy reminder that there have been bad times before today’s, and that people, great and small, saw them through.

","I had high hopes for this Winston Churchill biopic directed by Joe Wright, but it unfortunately fell well short of my expectations. It is simply an utter shame that while this is very far from the worst film of the year, it's undoubtedly the most disappointing one.

The film's narrative takes place during May 1940. The Nazis are beginning to take control of much of western Europe, and Winston Churchill is named Prime Minister after a dissatisfied government in Parliament convinces Neville Chamberlain to resign. Much has been said in the press about Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill. While he does a fine job, the somewhat overdone nature of his performance makes clear that it is unfortunately not the Oscar slam-dunk performance we were all hoping for. The film's supporting cast, however, is quite good--as is the rapid but engaging pacing of the story's narrative.

Unfortunately, what makes ""Darkest Hour"" a miss is the sad truth that the film's script is a disaster. The film exhausts itself with virtually every cliché in the biopic/historical costume drama genres, such as: young female characters that basically do nothing except help the male protagonist, a large group of strangers introducing themselves to the protagonist after recognizing him, a sentimental climax meant to simply 'tie everything up' rather than make the audience reflect critically on the subject of the biopic, etc. The writing fails to address the points that made Churchill such an effective leader. All in all, while not terrible, this is a very bland biopic that was a huge letdown for me. 4.5/10"
,,"Gary Oldman is one of the greatest actors on the planet – and he proves it again as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, director Joe Wright’s rip-roaring take on the celebrated Prime Minister’s first tumultuous month in office in May, 1940, when France and Belgium are a whisper away from surrendering to Hitler and Great Britain may be next. (How I’d love to see Oldman’s take on the Fuhrer). 

The British actor, 59, has played real people before, from Sid Vicious (Sid and Nancy) to Lee Harvey Oswald (JFK). But his Churchill is something different. At first, the slender chameleon is barely recognizable in his fat suit and buried under layers of artful, award-caliber makeup, courtesy of Japanese craftsman Kazuhiro Tsuji. But then something magical happens, like it does when the gods of cinema align. Those flashing eyes, brimming with mischief, are unmistakenly Oldman’s, and his vocal technique rises to the challenge of capturing one of the most eloquent, inspiring voices in history without indulging in mere mimicry. In his 35-year-film career, Oldman has only received one nomination from the Academy, for playing master spy George Smiley in 2011’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. This will surely end that oversight. Get busy engraving Oldman’s name on an Oscar right bloody now. And those fearing that Darkest Hour is nothing but a dull tableau of blowhard stuffed shirts will be relieved to know that they’re in for a lively, provocative historical drama that runs on its own nonstop creative fire. Wright introduces us to the great man lighting a cigar in bed – but from then on, the hard-drinking Churchill is on his feet and demanding attention like the brawling infant he resembles. Whether he’s terrorizing a timid, young typist (Lily James) or grumbling at criticism doled out by his loyal, impatient wife, Clementine (a sublimely tart Kristin Scott Thomas), Churchill, at 66, is a lion who’s definitely not ready for winter.

Working from a scrappy, dialogue-heavy script by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything), Wright brings a cinematic dynamism to every scene, even when confined to Churchill’s chambers, underground war rooms and the halls of Parliament. That’s where Churchill squeaks by as a compromise candidate, one who’s hated only slightly less than his Hitler-appeasing predecessor Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Though the evacuation of British soldiers on the beaches of Dunkirk will change the course of the war, no one knew that for sure … especially Churchill, who often hid his uncertainty in alcohol and a haze of cigar smoke. We see almost nothing of the Operation Dynamo action, which makes Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Dunkirk the perfect companion piece to Wright’s interior drama. (Oldman recently joked that Nolan’s epic was “the most expensive second unit” in film history. Ironically, both films will be vying against each other for awards this season.)

Wright has been much praised for bringing a modern energy to period pieces (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement), and he animates the hothouse atmosphere of Churchill’s gilded cage with thoughtful debate and vigorous visuals. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (Amelie, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) keeps his camera in a constant whirl, marching in time to a thrilling score by Dario Marianelli. The Prime Minsiter’s instinct to refuse peace talks with Germany brokered by Mussolini doesn’t sit well at first with King George (Ben Mendelsohn, in the same role that won Colin Firth an Oscar in The King’s Speech). But the unthinkable idea of an English regent in exile in Canada brings the two men closer together. The film falters slightly during an imagined scene in which Churchill sneaks off for a ride on the London underground and talks policy with a melting pot of commoners. But this distillation of London pride, of the king’s subjects shouting “Never!” to the possibility of seeing a Nazi flag flying over Buckingham Palace, is essential to Churchill’s insistence on war.

Oldman delivers Churchill’s famous radio speech (“We shall fight them on the beaches”) with all the rhetorical thunder it requires. But this consummate actor is arguably at his very best when he shows us the politician at his most vulnerable, backed against the wall and thwarted by those outside and inside his own inner circle. John Lithgow won an Emmy for playing Churchill in The Crown; the formidable Brian Cox and Michael Gambon joined the recent run of interpretations of the PM. Still, it’s Oldman, whose performance as Churchill feels definitive, revealing a fearsome, sometimes fearful man racked by self doubts and still able to find the conviction to rally his nation, and countless nations to come, to fight against living under the heel of tyranny. The victory of Darkest Hour as a film is not just to hear those word repeated, but to discover the flawed human being who carved those words out of the dark night of his own soul.","We go to the movies to be gripped by powerful narratives presented with good scripts and moving imagery. This film has all of it, most especially a riveting performance by Gary Oldman.

The subject matter will clearly divide audiences thanks to its pat view of history: UK as the righteous hero and everyone else as inept -- Italians and French losers, Germans the evil fascists, US completely unmentioned, Canada the quiet prairie for monarchs to escape to -- in the still-somewhat- mysterious Dunkirk incident where Hitler could easily have tightened the noose and pushed UK over the edge of what was evidently a crushing defeat, but somehow allowed them the leeway to escape by civilian boats. There's next to no mention of the French army that stood its ground and valiantly sacrificed itself to win a couple of days for the Brits on the beach.

All that said, as a film, this is a gripping narrative with just the kind of insouciant wit you'd expect from Churchill. While movies such as ""The Gathering Storm"" with Albert Finney were more considered, Darkest Hour is the kind of production that wows awards juries and audiences. Worthy watch when it comes to a theater near you. I feel Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" would be richer if you saw it *after* Darkest Hour."
,,"We first meet the future Prime Minister through the eyes of Elizabeth Layton (Lily James), a timid young typist who’s being sent into the slaughterhouse when she steps into Churchill’s bedroom in order to dictate his thoughts. Churchill is still tucked under the sheets with his pajamas on, looking every one of his 66 years. And yet, his speech — always delivered at a full bellow, even with a wet cigar dangling between his lips — is enough to make Elizabeth tremble and run from the room.

Screenwriter Anthony McCarten accurately remembers Churchill as a man in love with the sound of his own voice, and that quality alone is enough to make Gary Oldman the perfect choice to play him. One of the few actors whose performances are regularly big enough to be seen from space, Oldman has met his match. Here, for the first time, the star has found a character who’s larger than life itself; no matter how much hot air Oldman breathes into this balloon, it’s never going to pop. His Churchill might be the first lead performance in film history that’s delivered entirely in shouts, but it works.

Barely recognizable underneath 100 pounds of jowls, Oldman disappears into the role, and that’s all to its benefit. If Wright’s film is an intricate timepiece, then Oldman is the machinery just under its face: “Darkest Hour” doesn’t work without him, but it’s best that he remains invisible. Besides, how exciting could it possibly be to watch another British screen legend wind up their Winnie? Hell, with John Lithgow doing such a fine job of it on “The Crown,” even the American greats have gotten it down. No, this movie isn’t remarkable for what Oldman does, but rather for what Wright does with him.

McCarten’s script is limited to the month of May, and the majority of its action is confined to parliamentary halls and underground war rooms. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel shoots the former like he’s Janusz Kaminski, thick blades of of blinding sunlight beaming in from every window (all the better to capture the cigar smoke). He shoots the latter like Britain’s nerve center is an immaculate diorama, the camera gliding with purpose between rooms, down hallways, and across the blank spaces between sets like an episode of “The West Wing” as directed by Wes Anderson.

The restless fluidity of Wright’s style makes literal the idea of government as a machine in constant motion, and it restores a keen sense of urgency to one of the most famous global panics of the 20th century. The camerawork is never so dynamic that it makes Churchill’s success feel preordained, nor does it approach the snow-globe artificiality of Wright’s sublime “Anna Karenina,” but it rivetingly conveys the idea that brains and bluster were really the only tools at Churchill’s disposal. He certainly didn’t have any plans. Or hopes, for that matter.

Every day that ticks off the calendar is another day closer to surrender (or “peace talks”). Every day that passes is another day closer to the German Army routing the mass of British troops stationed at Dunkirk and Calais. The free world is on the brink of taking its last stand, and Churchill is sitting on a toilet and pleading with President Roosevelt to send him some ships.

To that point, “Darkest Hour” only wavers when Churchill does, it only slows down and lets some air out of the bag when Churchill begins to succumb to his doubts (this decline bottoming out in a fanciful scene where the Prime Minister comes face-to-face with his public). James, so damn winning on her own, isn’t given enough material to pick up the slack and meaningfully serve as Churchill’s conscience. Fortunately, Kristin Scott Thomas is aces as Winnie’s long-suffering wife, while Ben Mendelsohn outdoes Colin Firth as the stuttering King George VI, whose difficulties with words allowed him to recognize the power that Churchill could wield with them.

But the MVP here, the one person who’s able to hold the movie together despite all the dodgy bits in its latter half, is composer Dario Marianelli. Wright’s go-to guy has delivered some stunning work for the director in the past, but his score for “Darkest Hour” is a rare thing of beauty. Throbbing with vigor one moment, tumbling pianos towards despair the next, and then eventually entwining those disparate modes together into the cathartic bombast that accompanies Churchill’s famous speech (“We shall fight on the beaches…”), Marianelli’s music holds the film together, and the people of Britain along with it. At least until Churchill can find his rhythm and take things from there. By the time we cut (briefly) to the evacuation at Dunkirk, we’re all feeling the spirit — each and every viewer might as well be Mark Rylance loading up his pleasure boat and gallantly sailing into harm’s way.

This is a movie about the power of words, and those words have to rouse you into action. The movie wouldn’t work if you didn’t feel like Churchill mobilized the English language and sent it into battle. But you do — you do even before that perfect final image. Despots and tyrants have always been able to harness the power of words, but if certain current leaders prove anything, it’s that they only know how to use that power to incite. Winston Churchill could wield it to inspire. He could open his mouth and make a nation believe in themselves and in the nobility of their cause. And for that reason alone, our darkest hour was ultimately followed by the dawn.","I really enjoyed the movie and am a big Oldman fan. But got sad and even angry when I read about how every event that cought your attention is not true. Never took place. Pure fiction. Like the train ride, or the verbal battles about peace negotiations, or who initiated Operation Dynamo, or peoples reactions to his speeches.

I can accept when movie makers make 5 things happen in one day that actually took place on different days or merge 5 peripheral persons into one, as they so often do, to give it better momentum. But to take liberties with historical facts, the ones that make the foundation of the movie. Stop doing that... It should be illegal.

And for those in a bad mood now: Check out ""Young Winston"" from 1972. AFAIK depicts truth well, and at least I was surprised to know about his youth."
,,"ollowing recent turns by Brian Cox (Churchill), John Lithgow (The Crown), Michael Gambon (Churchill’s Secret) and Robert Hardy (Churchill: 100 Days That Saved Britain), the latest in a line of eminent thesps to tackle the sonorous role of Sir Winston is Gary Oldman.

And a masterful job he makes of it, too. The stomping walk, the jutting lower lip, the rhetorical delivery with its studied pauses – all this, with the help of some not-too-obtrusive prosthetics, transforms him very convincingly into the iconic wartime leader.

Not always so convincing are some of the things Joe Wright’s movie has Winston do. It all starts authentically enough: we’re in May 1940, the war’s going badly – disastrously – and beleaguered PM Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) realises he must stand down. Reluctantly, the cabinet decides that Churchill is the only man whom the opposition, and the country, will accept. Bolstered by his wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), he takes the job, but at once finds himself under pressure from all sides. Belgium and the Netherlands have fallen, the French army has been routed and the Brits have been pinned to a small enclave around Dunkirk. In the war cabinet, Churchill’s being urged – especially by Chamberlain and his ally Viscount Halifax (a vampiric Stephen Dillane) – to seek peace terms from Hitler. The Italian government is offering to mediate. 

Despite Clemmie encouraging him to stand firm, Churchill’s about to capitulate. But then he gets a visit from King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) who tells him he should consult “the people”. So Winston – having never been on a bus in his life – trots down to his local Tube station, buys himself a ticket (with the help of a friendly woman) and boards a train. There he encounters a range of assorted citizens who exhort him with one voice to defy Adolf. Buoyed up, Winston heads back to the House, rallies his party… and the rest is speech-making history. The absurdity of the Tube jaunt aside, most of Darkest Hour hits the spot. There’s great chemistry between Oldman and Scott Thomas, she coolly deflating Winston’s more intemperate outbursts, and between Oldman and Mendelsohn, as the king overcomes his aversion and starts to appreciate his bulldog PM. And Lily James, as the PM’s put-upon secretary, has a sweet moment when she explains he must do his V for victory sign the other way around, lest it mean “Up yer bum!” (Cue helpless chortles from Churchill.)

We’re covering well-trodden ground, but the thunderous energy of Oldman’s performance, backed up by Wright’s sinewy camerawork, carries it through.","This film is absolutely brilliant from the acting to the sets..the editing is tight. Thrilling. It took me about 1 minute to accept Gary Oldham as Churchill...after that I was sold.

Probably my favorite film of 2017 so far. Pacing is superb. Historically pretty accurate

It's a must see for any WW2 fans, political fans and Winston Churchill fans."
,,"Do we need more Dunkirk? After Lone Scherfig’s winsome Their Finest and Christopher Nolan’s technical opus Dunkirk, it’s been a big year for reenactments of those harrowing days, when hundreds of thousands of British troops were evacuated from a France lost to fascism at the start of World War II. Their Finest dealt with the mythologizing of the event—propaganda filmmakers telling the story of the Little Ships, or one little ship, to stoke American support for joining the war—while Dunkirk showed us, in stressful detail, the scene on the ground, at sea, and in the air.

But another mechanic was at work in this story, one we’ve not yet seen. (This year, anyway.) There were political decisions determining how this all shook out, made in smoky London rooms by men tasked with preserving the legacy of the empire. To add that final panel to the triptych, we’ve got the third part of this year’s accidental Dunkirk trilogy: Darkest Hour, Joe Wright’s talky and handsome movie about Winston Churchill resolutely resisting defeat, opening November 22.

There have been depictions of Churchill in wartime before, most recently Brendan Gleeson in an Emmy-winning performance in 2009’s HBO movie Into the Storm. (John Lithgow just won an Emmy for playing a post-War Churchill, too.) We’ve also seen a lot of King George VI on screen lately, between The King’s Speech and The Crown. This mid-century British era is so laden with cinematic reverence and valorization at this point that it tends to groan and creak, doesn’t it, overworked and yielding little new insight. Yet Wright has found an untapped wellspring, using Anthony McCarten’s sometimes overweeningly clever script to beat a propulsive path through familiar material, giving us both a compelling process movie, full of speech and spittle, and an arresting little character study. Well, perhaps I shouldn’t say little. As Churchill—heavy and shambling, sozzled with drink and haunted by specters of war—Gary Oldman gives one of those towering, transformative performances that often earn a raft of gold hardware. (Oldman is, indeed, the Oscar front-runner this year.) It’s by no means a little performance. But the glimpses we get into Churchill’s psyche are sparing, quick references to the failures of Gallipoli and his bouts of depression, before he musters up and soldiers on. Still, we do get some sense of the man as he might have been—alternately bellowing and jocular, a pampered aristocrat whose talent for rhetoric could back up, or forgive, much of his diva bluster. Oldman does a wizardly bit of becoming, making all these changes in voice, bearing, and proportion without putting on too many actorly airs; for how complex it is, Oldman’s is a remarkably unfussy performance.

One lead actor whipping themselves up into a froth of impersonation does not a successful movie make, though many biopics and historical films have relied on that assumption and been, unfairly or not, rewarded for it. (The Last King of Scotland and The Iron Lady come to mind.) But Joe Wright is Joe Wright, and though he’s perhaps been a bit cowed by the global flop that was Pan, he’s still a filmmaker for whom little can be simple. Darkest Hour is full of canny, complicated shots, Wright putting cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel through his paces to capture hazy parliamentary chambers, clanking elevators and secret tunnels, long gliding shots of London city life bearing up amidst war’s ominous creep. There’s a lot going on, all of it working hard to counterbalance Oldman’s gravitational pull. Wright mostly pulls it off, which is a nice surprise. In the past, I’ve been allergic to the director’s signature flourishes, his dazzling but oddly empty pieces of flair. He overwhelmed the delicate emotional timbres of Atonement, Ian McEwan’s wrenching wonder of a novel, with Dario Marianelli’s clacking score and a heap of overeager visual ta-das, most notably a stunningly mounted but largely unnecessary five-minute tracking shot on the beaches of—you guessed it—Dunkirk. He similarly smothered Anna Karenina, an impressive contraption devoid of any real heat. Until Darkest Hour, only his Hanna—so loopy and surreal and self-aware—really worked for me, successfully marrying style and substance.

In Darkest Hour, Wright manages to find the power in restraint, though his film is still far more mannered and art-directed than your standard political chamber piece. He uses big, dramatic title cards to tell us the day and date, as German forces advance on the stranded British army on the Channel coast and certain high-ranking MPs plead with Churchill to seek a peace treaty—a surrender, essentially—with Hitler. Another churning Marianelli score, this time quite welcome, rolls us along, Wright pausing the bombast on a occasion for a quiet moment with two women in Churchill’s life: a sweet assistant played by Lily James (appealing as ever), and Churchill’s wife, Clemmie, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, doing her most with what could have been merely a bland supportive wife role. (I mean, it still is mostly that, but Scott Thomas adds extra salt and pepper.) Though there is plenty of portent rumbling around the film, Wright admirably staves off melodrama or sentimentalism. The film has a crisp British comportment—a dutiful, cheerio resolve—that serves it quite well.

At least, until the film turns inward to gaze at that resolve, and suddenly grows flabby. McCarten and Wright have—not quite disastrously, but close—imagined an extended sequence in which Churchill breaks with formality and finds himself on the London Tube, alone with the common people, where he asks the assorted masses—a bricklayer, a mum, a black fellow—what they would say to the prospect of ceding autonomy to the Nazis. You better believe they tell old Winston to give the Krauts hell, in what is supposed to be an inspiring scene showing the spunk and tenaciousness of everyday Britons, but instead has the stink of pandering—to subject and audience. Especially because it never actually happened! It’s a galling misstep for a movie that has, heretofore, been rather sturdy and dignified.

Ah well. The film isn’t ruined by this misguided scene, and Wright sends us out of the theater roused and ready for action. Which, of course, is where the film finds its relevance to today, this story of resistance and persistence in the face of an implacable and dangerous ideology. Extrapolate from that what you will. Darkest Hour doesn’t exactly bonk you over the head with the allegory, but it’s there for the taking if you want it. If not, the film can simply exist as a smartly and elegantly tailored war drama—not about the personnel, per se, but the policy. It’s certainly a good companion piece to Dunkirk, these two British directors of about the same age grappling with their nation’s most foundational modern history in their own idiosyncratic ways.

Watch the films back to back this Thanksgiving, maybe. Afterward, if you’re not quite done with Dunkirk, do seek out Their Finest, to see what a Dane has to say about this same dark, but not hopeless, moment in time. It’s my bittersweet favorite part of the tapestry. Think of it as dessert: sweet, inviting, but no less nourishing.","History is rewritten to make Churchill into a fountain of millennial angst, and turning his life into a commentary of the current times. Its insulting the he claims this is a historical movies in the interviews. Honestly just go watch Dunkirk again and then go get the Paul Johnson or the Martin Gilbert biography on Churchill."
Dunkirk,Oscar,"A clue to this puzzle comes early in the film. Up onscreen appear the phrases “1. The Mole,” “2. The Sea,” and “3. The Air.” They introduce us to the three narrative strands that will wind through the next hundred minutes or so; notice the hint of the elemental. The Mole refers to a concrete jetty jutting into Dunkirk Harbor, whereas the air is the domain of a Spitfire pilot (Tom Hardy). When we first encounter him, he is already aloft, in a formation of three. Never do we discover which squadron he belongs to, or what sort of life he has left behind on the ground. For the most part, all that we see of him is his goggled eyes; not until the finale are we shown the rest of him, and only in the ensuing credits do we find out that he is called Farrier. It must have taken Hardy almost an entire morning to learn his lines, which seem even sparser than his dialogue for “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015), although, as we know from that masterwork, the less we hear from him the tighter our grasp of his character, and the greater the powers that seem to be held in check. At one point in “Dunkirk,” Farrier, low on fuel, is faced with a choice: pursue a German bomber that is harrying a warship crammed with evacuees, or turn tail and head for home before the tank runs dry? He says nothing, but those eyes reveal all. We follow his thoughts as clearly as we do every tip and tilt of his wings.
No such clarity below. Men are lined up on the shore, hoping to get onto one of the ships that dock in the harbor, but a sullen quiet prevails; the next bomb could shred and scatter them, and they cannot predict where it will hit. Shouldering through the crowd are a couple of young British soldiers with a stretcher, who are trying to get one of the wounded on board—and maybe, in the process, sneak a berth themselves. Gradually, one of them, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), gains a foothold in the drama, though you couldn’t call him the hero, for there is no main character in “Dunkirk.” Instead, various figures move onstage and off: Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh), who oversees the embarkation; Alex (Harry Styles), a fellow-evacuee whom Tommy meets halfway through; and a numb and nameless man (Cillian Murphy) found shuddering on a capsized hull. Silent at first, he eventually mutters, “U-boat.” Meanwhile, out in the English Channel, and heading to Dunkirk, is the Moonstone, skippered by Dawson (Mark Rylance), her owner. (In truth, the majority of Little Ships were requisitioned for the voyage across, but there were exceptions, and that is why Dawson casts off just before the uniformed authorities can reach him.) He recognizes a Spitfire from its growling thrum overhead, without having to glance up. “Rolls-Royce Merlin engine,” he says. “Sweetest sound you could hear out here.” He is no more voluble than the rest of the folk in this film, who seem either stunned by events or taut with determination, but Rylance, as ever, conveys a vigor of spirit through the simple crispness of his gestures. He removes his jacket on departure, and, throughout the ordeal, wears a white shirt, a tie, and a sweater, as if he were doing a bit of Sunday gardening rather than hauling a shoal of his countrymen, half-drowned and drenched in oil, from the unfriendly waves.
How to account for the impact that is made by “Dunkirk”? After all, there are so many ways in which the film falls short, and so many directions in which Nolan decides not to tack. Anybody wishing to understand the niceties of Operation Dynamo will be confounded, as will anyone expecting the sight of high-ranking strategists huddled around maps in low-lit situation rooms. (We do hear one of Churchill’s speeches, but only when a young man reads it aloud from a newspaper.) Nor does the film convince as a period drama. Most of the soldiers, who should look pinched and ration-fed, are well nourished, handsome, and unmistakably modern specimens—oddly well spoken, too, and lacking that earth-dark humor with which combatants everywhere seek to lighten their load and to wrestle down their dread. Most anachronistic of all are the tears that cloud Bolton’s eyes at the approach of the Little Ships. As a rule, senior officers, tasked with the mass relocation of men, have neither the time nor the inclination to weep.
Yet the movie works. Time and again, the action swells and dips, like a wave, then suddenly delivers a salty slap in the face. From above, we see a pilot ditching his damaged Spitfire in the sea, and the procedure runs smoothly; later, another flier does the same, and we stay with him as he lands. A tumult of water rushes toward him and fills the cockpit at alarming speed, while he batters on the canopy above, which refuses to slide open. Smoothness, viewed from another angle, collapses into the roughness of panic. Likewise, we join a throng of rescued men, belowdecks on a naval vessel, who are served bread and jam and—as in every moment of crisis, this being a British enterprise—mugs of tea. Then a torpedo hits. All becomes darkness and deluge. Humans turn into creatures of the deep. A pale hand flickers like a fish.Nolan has described “Dunkirk” as less a war film than a survival film, but it’s even more basic than that, in the way it lures us in and keeps us hooked. It is about what we do—how we suffer and retort—when things happen to us, and when the happening grows far beyond our control. There is plenty of agency here, much of it valiant, not least in Farrier’s dogfights, but the focus is on the inflicted; aside from a few shadowy forms in the closing minutes, no Germans are visible at all. Look at the British who hide in the belly of a beached fishing boat, which unseen enemy troops are using for target practice. Look at the evacuees on the Mole, turning their backs as a bomb bursts nearby and being caught in the gust of spray; we don’t actually witness the explosion, any more than they do. We need to feel their fear.
And so the fates keep drumming down like rain. By constantly cutting between the three stories, Nolan, the master of all he surveys, allows us no chance to relax before the next onslaught begins. Hans Zimmer’s music may pilfer from Elgar’s “Nimrod,” the most patriotically charged of the Enigma Variations, yet such bombast is not really required, and the rest of the score is more attuned to the film’s suspense; the strings unleash a machine-gun stutter, and a ticking sound suggests not a clock but a countdown to detonation. Although “Dunkirk” is not as labyrinthine as Nolan’s “Memento” (2000) or “Inception” (2010), its strike rate upon our senses is rarely in doubt, and there is a beautiful justice in watching it end, as it has to, in flames. Land, sea, air, and, finally, fire: the elements are complete, honor is salvaged, and the men who were lost scrape home. ♦","And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.
While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given.
I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed.
This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet."
,,"Very much like the pivotal historical event it celebrates, “Dunkirk” confounds expectations. Both intimate and epic, as emotional as it is tension-filled, it is being ballyhooed as a departure for bravura filmmaker Christopher Nolan, but in truth the reason it succeeds so masterfully is that it is anything but.

What happened at the French coastal town of Dunkirk between May 26 and June 4, 1940, was perhaps World War II’s unlikeliest turnaround, as a complete military fiasco transmogrified into a stirring psychological victory capped by Winston Churchill’s stirring “we shall fight on the beaches” speech.

This battle has fascinated writer-director Nolan for years — he once crossed the English Channel on a small boat specifically to get a sense of the setting — and he’s brought a multifaceted examination of it to the screen in a way that’s both structurally daring and evocative of old-school David Lean-style storytelling. Using a cast that adroitly mixes young actors making their feature-film debuts (including former One Direction member Harry Styles) with canny veterans such as Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy, “Dunkirk” resembles previous Nolan films like “The Dark Knight” trilogy and “Inception” in concrete as well as thematic ways.

 Working with repeat collaborators including cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Lee Smith and composer Hans Zimmer, Nolan demonstrates his all-enveloping skill with the tools of narrative, a deep understanding of and commitment to craft as well as — witness his telling actor Styles that his boots were laced wrong — a willingness to care about the myriad details of filmmaking. Shooting with both Imax and 65mm cameras, some of which were specially designed for small spaces, Nolan not only dazzles us with immersive, God’s-eye perspectives, he understands, as always, that a big screen image pulls you into details like cigarette butts left on a windowsill, that huge close-ups can enhance intimacy and increase immediacy. If you don’t see “Dunkirk” on the biggest screen you can find, you’ll be missing the heart of the experience. As he’s said in numerous interviews, Nolan has conceived of his film not as a historical drama but rather a Hitchcockian thriller where, aided and abetted by Smith’s razor cutting and Zimmer’s crescendoing score, clocks are relentlessly ticking on any number of fronts.

And though much has been made about “Dunkirk” being Nolan’s first film about historical events, on examination that feels like a distinction without a difference. Almost all of his films, even the Batman ones, can be looked at as involving ordinary people being thrust into extraordinary circumstances. That is the case with a vengeance here.

Because of the complexity of what happened at Dunkirk, Nolan has divided his film into three distinct but interlocking narratives, intercutting between actions on the ground, on the sea and in the air — and making it all fit into a crisp 1 hour and 47 minutes.

Though Dunkirk was an enormous event, with close to 400,000 British and Allied troops trapped on that French beach with the Germans about to pounce, Nolan has concentrated on small groups of men whose stories stand in for the larger whole.

What keeps “Dunkirk” from being completely straightforward is a kind of temporal sleight of hand. While the action on land unfolds over a week, what happens on sea takes place in a single day and the air battles unfold in a mere hour. By placing these different time frames on an equal footing, “Dunkirk” enlarges our experience and keeps us on our toes.

It’s the land war we encounter first, watching Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) running for his life as German bullets pursue him though deserted streets. Suddenly the vastness of the Dunkirk beach, as surreal as a Di Chirico landscape, opens up in front of him. (Nolan shot on the real location, which was swept for unexploded ordnance as a precaution).

The land part of “Dunkirk” is called “the mole,” another word for the beach’s stone breakwater with a wooden pier built onto it where long lines of troops are waiting patiently to be evacuated.

Tommy and the other impossibly young soldiers he meets, including the quiet Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) and the edgier Alex (Styles) employ a range of stratagems in their desperation to get on a ship that will take them home. But because safe places can become deathtraps in a heartbeat, feeling secure and out of danger as German planes periodically attack with bullets and bombs is not in the cards. While the soldiers are young and not really sure what is going on, older and wiser heads fill us in, primarily Navy Commander Bolton, finely done by a gimlet-eyed Kenneth Branagh decades past his own young hero days as Henry V.

It is Bolton who explains that because of the shallow nature of Dunkirk’s beach, small vessels would be needed to rescue the men. A call had gone out to Britain’s boat owners to help, and in fact hundreds of self-motivated small ships (a dozen of the real craft appear in the film) took up the task.

Among those is the Moonstone, owned and piloted by a man named Dawson (Mark Rylance, letter-perfect as always). With him is his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and his son’s friend George (Barry Keoghan), but their task is complicated when they pick up a shell-shocked survivor who wants only to go home (Nolan veteran Cillian Murphy).

The most exhilarating “Dunkirk” episodes, not surprisingly, are the aerial battles fought against the Germans by a trio of Spitfires. The aerial panoramas cinematographer Van Hoytema and his crew capture are truly dizzying, and having Tom Hardy, an actor whose presence makes the most of confining spaces, as one of the pilots is a major bonus.

Although tension about who will live and who will die is always front and center in a film like this, one of the confounding things about “Dunkirk” is that behind the scenes Nolan and company are quietly building a surprising amount of emotion. By the close, just like those of the troops that did survive, we’re taken unawares by how moving what we’ve been through has been.

For the surpassing accomplishment of “Dunkirk” is to make us feel an almost literal fusion with its story. It’s not so much that we’ve seen a splendid movie, though we have, but as if we’ve been taken inside a historic event, become wholly immersed in something real and alive. Like a debacle turned into a triumph, that is something that doesn’t happen every day.","Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.

The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.

The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings."
,,"Dunkirk instantly enters the pantheon of great war films, alongside Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, and The Final Countdown. Okay, so maybe that last one doesn’t count as “great” and it’s pretty much a 50/50 split between war and sci-fi, but I still hold it in extremely high esteem. War is hell no matter what time portal you cruise through, I suppose.

Christopher Nolan, who can seemingly do no wrong when it comes to large-scale mayhem paired with smaller scenes and subplots rife with storm-cloud emotions, tackles one of World War II’s legendary retreats. In late May of 1940 – before the U.S. entered the war – Hitler’s army and Luftwaffe blitzkrieged their way across Belgium and France in a matter of days with the end result being some 350,000 British, French, Belgian, and Canadian troops trapped on the beach at Dunkirk, France, just miles and a stormy English Channel away from home and salvation. Churchill, rightly foreseeing the upcoming Battle of Britain, held much of the Royal Navy and Air Force in check, severely limiting the chances of rescue for the allies stuck on the beach. (He hoped to rescue only 35,000-40,000 men.) Instead, in a genuinely patriotic move, a civilian armada of pleasure craft and fishing boats sailed off into the rough seas to save as many of their own as they could. Along with British destroyers, they plucked almost 340,000 soldiers from the French coast, even as German U-boats sunk surrounding vessels and heroic RAF Spitfires engaged German Heinkels and Messerschmitts in that air above. After the evacuation, Churchill would deliver his legendary rallying cry, “We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and on the streets … we will never surrender,” while also adding that “wars are not won by evacuations.”

That’s the historical context. Nolan, seamlessly weaving together several disparate stories at once, condenses history to its sheer essence: terrified troops lined up in columns awaiting rescue while being strafed from the clouds; a RAF pilot (Hardy) doing his nail-gnawing best to provide air cover even as his plane runs perilously low on fuel; a Mr. Dawson (Rylance, brilliant), steering his yacht into the channel alongside his son and a classmate friend; and British Commander Bolton (Branagh) standing on the Dunkirk “mole” (pier) waiting to get his men to safety. And then there’s the every-soldier, Tommy (Whitehead), who acts as the audience’s main POV. The performances are blisteringly bang-on right across the board.

Dunkirk is nothing if not a sustained effort on the part of the entire cast and crew to turn the audience’s knuckles permanently white. Nolan maintains gut-wrenching suspense throughout by cross-cutting between the various characters and their plights. I’d go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic. Well done, sir, well done.

I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me."
,,"Most days we appear to live in a world gone mad, a time and place in which ignorance of history is treated as a kind of virtuous purity. But sometimes, cosmically, the right movie arrives at just the right time: right now Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk feels like a salve. Its visual and sound effects are elaborate and impressive. This is a grand spectacle, not an empty one, a rare example of the Hollywood blockbuster dollar well spent. Dunkirk is extraordinary not just because it’s ambitious and beautifully executed, but because Nolan, who both wrote and directed it, has put so much care into its emotional details—and has asked so much of, and trusted, his actors. As great filmmakers before him—Lewis Milestone, Sam Fuller, Brian De Palma—knew, you can’t tell a story of war without faces. Faces carry history. They’re genetic maps, but they’re vessels of spiritual memory too. Dunkirk, set against events that happened more than 75 years ago, is like a message from a lost world. If the setting feels unfamiliar to you, don’t worry, trust the faces. Dunkirk, in theaters July 21, is a fictional story set amid real events of late May and early June 1940. The capitulation of Belgium left Allied troops trapped between German forces and the French coast. America, still in the grip of isolationism, would not enter the Second World War until the following year. Driven back by the enemy, Allied soldiers became stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk. And, against all odds, some 338,000 were rescued. The backbone of Operation Dynamo, as the mission was called, was a flotilla of around 700 small fishing and pleasure boats, many of them captained by their owners, private British citizens who made the treacherous English Channel crossing to assist military vessels in bringing the troops home. That rescue came to be known as the Miracle of Dunkirk.

Any historical event can take on a sheen of nostalgic sentimentality with the passage of time, particularly when it’s dramatized on the big screen. History demands a degree of shaping to make sense on film. But if the Dunkirk evacuation is a sturdy, made-for-the-movies heroic narrative, it’s also one that’s both humble and humbling. This is a story of regular people who took action without hesitation, joining forces, at great personal risk, to form an invincible whole. These were big men in little boats.","Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). ""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...

First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous.

Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre.

The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes.

As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone.

This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.

Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10."
,,"It’s not enough to say that “Dunkirk” is Christopher Nolan’s best film. It’s one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies — they are rare — that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. “Dunkirk” is that kind of movie.

The battle of Dunkirk was not a victory but a successful evacuation, and Nolan doesn’t try to give it the contours of a conventional tale of triumph. When France fell to Hitler in 1940, it left 400,000 Allied soldiers, most of them British — basically the entire British Army — stranded on the beach, needing transport across the English Channel. To convey a sense of that day, Nolan stays focused on a handful of soldiers, sailors, RAF pilots and civilian volunteers, all struggling to do their part and go home.

If we know the history, we know that almost 340,000 were successfully evacuated and lived to fight another day — and for years thereafter — and that Hitler missed his best and only chance to win World War II in a single blow. But Nolan takes us into a mind-set that doesn’t know these things. He throws us into the middle of the action, where there is no grand scheme and no overview, just moment-by-moment struggle. And from the point of view of the men on that beach, in the boats and in the air, it seems inconceivable that any of them, much less most of them, could possibly survive.

“Dunkirk” begins, as great films often will, with a scene of wonder and awe that lets us know, virtually from the first frame, that the filmmaker has his teeth into something big. We see a half dozen soldiers from behind, walking down the middle of the road in a picturesque French village. The colors are saturated to beautiful effect, and papers are billowing down from the sky. And then a soldier picks one up and we see that it’s leaflet that has been dropped from an enemy airplane, telling the Allies that they’re surrounded, that it’s hopeless, and that they should surrender.

A skirmish immediately follows this, except that it’s barely even a skirmish. It’s just soldiers getting shot at and running for their lives. They never see who’s shooting at them, and neither do we. It’s chaos. Soon, the movie settles on a single soldier, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) to become a major focus, but we don’t know much about him, and we never find out. “Dunkirk” is not a war movie where everybody gets to have a scintillating personality. Rather, it depicts a hiatus from personality, an ordeal in which life, under assault, is reduced to the basics.

This distance has the unique effect of keeping us from fully identifying with one character as the viewer’s surrogate, in a way that, say, Tom Hanks was our surrogate in “Saving Private Ryan.” In this way, Nolan doesn’t offer us a replacement for our participation in the war. Rather, he enlists us in the war ourselves, so that we jump out of our skins when snipers shoot holes in a boat that we feel that we’re on. And we react in terror when the ocean blazes with an oil fire, as men, underwater, hold their breath and try to find a safe spot to resurface.

Nolan forces us out of the usual movie mode of thinking, well, so long as the hero survives, everything will be OK. He involves us instead in every scene and every disaster and near disaster, so that we feel it — and end up, by the end of the film, drained and exhausted and yet strangely excited, in the way great art is always exciting. We’re in the plane with Tom Hardy as an RAF pilot, trying to prevent the German planes from bombing the British boats, just as we are with Mark Rylance as an average British citizen, piloting his pleasure boat to Dunkirk in hope of rescuing his countrymen. Like the men at Dunkirk, the actors do their duty to the fullest, but no one stands out from the pack, because it’s not that kind of movie. In this way and others, “Dunkirk” feels supremely and appropriately English. It’s all no fuss, no bother and no obvious tugging at the emotions, but the emotions are there. It’s all in day’s work — but what a day’s work.","It's hard to understand critic ratings of 10/10 while this movie undeniably lacks quality on some very important aspects. Let me start off with some positive notes:

IMAX: The impact of the bullets and bombs felt as if you were really there. The entire movie is shot in a very realistic way.


Opening scene: The suspense, music and cinematography all came together very well in the opening scene, which really made me excited for the scenes to come.


Acting: Poor acting can easily distract the audience from their experience of being in a certain time/place. But there was not a single moment in which an actor did something out of character. All expressions were very believable. Great acting!


But there were some major aspects I had issues with:

Characters: The characters did not have any background story and there's hardly any dialogue to give some insight. The main characters are therefore replaceable for any other random soldier on that beach. I do not expect an elaborate introduction of every character, certainly not in a historical war movie, but the downside is that the audience cannot empathize with the main characters. I really didn't care for one of them to die. I've seen hundreds of soldiers die in earlier scenes of the movie, why would one or two more (just as hollow and unknown as any other soldier) bother me a bit? It's no must to focus on character development, as long as the other aspects of the movie make up for the lack of it. In Dunkirk that sadly was not the case.


Editing: Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I find this non-linear storytelling and continuity breaks unnecessary and poorly executed.


Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Especially the flight scenes did not add much to the story. Instead I rather would've seen some scenes at the front-line with troops actually defending the beach instead of just a bunch of scared, helpless troops waiting for the next plane to fly over and bomb the shite out of them. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes.


Music: Usually I enjoy Zimmer's score. But in this movie there was no moment of silence, not a moment to break the suspense. Especially in IMAX, my ears were buzzing hours after I left the cinema. Was this intentional? Was it supposed to feel like one big action scene without any breaks, to get the same feeling of those soldiers, trapped between battles unable to take a break, constantly in stress of a nearing attack? Well, than Nolan did succeed. But I found it very annoying.


Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!"
,,"Something curious happens to time in Christopher Nolan’s movies. On screen, it twists and dances and coils enticingly; off screen, it vanishes. His magnificent new film, “Dunkirk,” seems to be over in a flash — you disappear inside of it and it changes you, as all great movies do.


Based on a remarkable story from World War II, “Dunkirk” unfolds on land, on the sea and in the air. The land is a vast beach in Dunkirk, France, in May 1940, where hundreds of thousands of British soldiers are trapped — the English Channel on one side, enemy forces on the other. The sea is that choppy, green-gray Channel, where a small wooden yacht named Moonstone, manned by a middle-aged father (Mark Rylance) and his teenage son (Tom Glynn-Carney), is one of hundreds of nonmilitary vessels summoned by the British government in a vast, unprecedented evacuation mission. And the air is above the Channel, where an RAF Spitfire pilot (Tom Hardy) battles the Luftwaffe planes — despite a shot-out gas gauge. These three stories, taking place in their own time (the evacuation on the beach takes days; the flight, a mere hour) yet interwoven, each feel like an entire world; you watch realizing that you’re not breathing. Two young soldiers on the beach, desperate to get onto a hospital boat, grab a stretcher and race through the endless crowds waiting on the mole (a long wooden pier); we don’t know their names or their stories, but we race with them. A shellshocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) stranded at sea, picked up by the father and son, panics upon realizing that they are headed back into war — “I’m not going back,” he says, his eyes mirrors of horror, and you see the hell of combat that “Dunkirk” doesn’t show us.

And, in one quiet nod of approval between the father and son — and in Rylance’s beautifully subtle portrayal of quiet, determined decency — you see the essence of this story: These young men fought, and these scores of regular Brits climbed into boats to go retrieve them, because it was, simply, the right thing to do.

“Dunkirk” succeeds spectacularly both emotionally and visually. (See it in large format if you possibly can; I saw it in IMAX, at Pacific Science Center, and am still reeling. “Dunkirk” is screening in a variety of formats; check tickets.dunkirkmovie.com for a listing of local theaters showing it in 70mm and IMAX.) That chilly sea looks endless from the seat of that Spitfire; the lines of men on the beach appear impossibly long; that boat seems tiny amid the waves. Remarkable action sequences unfurl, particularly a breathtaking late scene in which flames from a sinking ship engulf the sea.

But it’s the quiet moments that linger with you after this film, and the aching sense of home — both as something we yearn for, and something that takes care of us — that pervades it. “Dunkirk” is not a story of triumph, but one of living to fight another day, with a little help from our friends. “All we did was survive,” says a quiet soldier, near the end. For now, he’s told, “that’s enough.”","Being an avid war film fan, I was beyond excited seeing the trailer for Dunkirk and couldn't wait until it hit theatres. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. By the end of the film, I was actually mad.
I have to agree with some of the reviewers here who've stated that many of these glowing reviews are paid for, because what they're describing isn't even the same film.
Before the artsy-fartsy daggers come out--no, I don't need tons of backstory to feel invested in the characters. It's war, it's brutal, and I can surmise what it must be like for these brave souls. But when I come out the film and can't remember a single character's name (or worse, even care about them), that's just crap storytelling. Art should inspire a connection. This left me devoid of anything to be honest.
Scale...I may as well have been watching a tiny pocket of some soldiers, fighting some war, taking place somewhere. Part of what's so astonishing and inspiring about Dunkirk was its sheer scale. This insipid attempt to condense it to bite-sized POVs is insulting. You would expect at the end when the character (I literally can't remember his name) began reading Churchill's announcement to be roused by emotion. But since the film didn't generate any, and the delivery was so bland, it didn't even click with me what he was reading until I heard, ""We shall fight on the beaches.""
Lastly, a film doesn't have to be linear so I don't mind differing time lines. This however, was like some art-house, ""look at how cool I play with time"" film school project. I'm sorry...GAWD I'm sorry... but this was bad. I think about 100+ reviews explained why it doesn't work.
"
,,"The boy (Fionn Whitehead) appears to be nameless. It doesn’t matter, really. He could be any young man. And he has the will to survive.
Here come the Luftwaffe in their planes. Black dots in the sky, like descending gargoyles. The sound of arriving engines howls to a high pitch. The boy, petrified as he may be, reacts as well as he can. He ducks. Bombs drop. The boy is tightly photographed in the foreground, clasping his head. Boom. Boom. BOOM. The drops get closer and closer to the boy. BOOM! And then … the air clears. The bombs stop. The boy is safe, at least for now.
That’s just the opening five minutes of Dunkirk. Relax, you can breathe now. But make it quick. More’s coming. Dunkirk is overwhelming in an exceptional sort of way, a film that demands close study of everything seen and heard. It’s a series of functioning contradictions, walking a tightrope in a stomach-dropping exercise of assured craftsmanship. It’s a film both timeless and of-the-moment. Airy, yet packed to the brim. Fast, but reflective. It’s a white-knuckle fable that strips the politics and gore of war down to the most elemental and essential storytelling. This is a film of fear, hope, and survival. The technical acumen, fleet-footed pacing, traversing narratives, and insistence on precise artistry and design make Dunkirk unlike any other blockbuster on the market. And yet it learns and borrows from the great films, taking the time to maximize its photographic, editorial, and musical elements to stirring effect.
It’s in the tilt of the camera that drowns a shipman. The eyes of young soldiers looking on in hope of escape. The vibration of the camera riding with a pilot. The turquoise and tan and rose-colored environments. The frayed violins in Hans Zimmer’s score. The euphoric catharsis that arrives after ceaseless peril. This is a rare sort of entertainment. Study it. Be ensnared by it. This is Christopher Nolan’s new clockwork classic, Dunkirk.
Nolan recalls the Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo. It’s one of the great, under-told war stories of the 21st century, and has rarely appeared on film (the 1958 film Dunkirk, the stirring single-take journey in Atonement). The English were in retreat after the Battle of Dunkirk, and in trying to leave the beaches, the overcrowded sand and sea made the Allied forces sitting ducks for the Germans. But the subsequent events, including a flotilla of civilian ships coming to the rescue, is nothing short of spectacular. The events of Dunkirk tell of humanitarian salvation, speaking to British identity – a gripping lost-but-won historical narrative.
Dunkirk presents these events through a nesting-doll triptych of inspired creation, as Nolan creates a swirling, encroaching clock of stories. There’s segment one, “The Mole,” a week-long series of events revolving around the foot soldiers of Dunkirk (including the aforementioned boy). The Mole refers to the giant stone walls on the beaches of Dunkirk, which housed so many men waiting for ships. These moles acted like shooting galleries for German planes, so the soldiers would crouch, hide, and save themselves by any means necessary. The boy and other young soldiers sneak onto boats, hide under piers, crouch in the bowels of beached ships. Sometimes they just hit the sand and pray when the bombs drop.
There’s part two, “The Sea.” It takes place over one day, and focuses on the armada of ships coming to help. Nolan specifically zones in on a father and two boys; Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance, evoking great courage and worry) is a weekend sailor, but he’s got a job to do, as he puts it. He’s the film’s thematic through-line, with simple statements on the urgency of the matter, demystifying the complications of the Dunkirk situation. “There’s no hiding from this,” he cants to a PTSD-stricken fighter (Cillian Muprhy) on his boat.
Part three, “The Air,” takes place over one hour and revolves around two Spitfire pilots, Collins (Jack Lowden) and Farrier (Tom Hardy). It’s a stunning series of aerial ballets, as the pair swoop and careen through the sky to shoot down planes and avoid being shot themselves. Fuel is limited. Time is of the essence. They must stop the Germans from eviscerating destroyers and boats and more men. Their emotions are expressed solely through the eyes behind their bomber masks.
By minimalizing his loftier techniques and tendencies of the past with brusque pacing and grand photography, Nolan has assembled the leanest and most impassioned film of his career. The editorial trickery is less a gimmick than a means of impact, and Nolan’s other choices are equally perfect. The dialogue is sparse; faces, eyes, and physical action do the talking, and historical events become impressionistic. He’s interested in the moods and feelings found in trials by fire, more so than the superlative effects. The beauteous horizon lines of Old Hollywood films are framed with Dutch angles from cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, reinforcing that nothing is safe or secure. The sudden color changes between shots and stories fit every moment, whether it’s a cool blue sunset or a whitened lens flare to illustrate a captain’s dread. Helmets for the fallen. Sea foam and crashing waves perpetuating the constant flow of war. Zimmer’s score samples clock sounds alongside twisted strings and synthesizers, building an orchestra with the speed of a ‘90s action film that fits the film’s momentum. The actors involved – Kenneth Branagh, James D’Arcy, pop star supreme Harry Styles – give assured, nuanced, and evocative performances, encapsulating the grief, woe, and determination required of people in this situation. Everything in its right place.
Early on, Nolan squarely frames two boys lifting a gurney and running across the beach to get a wounded soldier onto a parting ship. They clearly want to use his injury to get on board themselves. No words are really spoken; they just know this is a way out. On the soundtrack, two disparate strings begin to emerge, forming an edgy pizzicato as each struggles to match the other. Nolan tracks the duo as they try to muscle their way through the crowd, through holes in the pier and other obstacles, utilizing handheld camerawork at points to enforce the claustrophobia and their inability to leave. Will they make it? Will this work? Nolan never misses a note. His form is divine, and conjures all the enthusiasm of a professional working at his peak, while playing with new ideas. And the gurney sequence is just one great progression of image, sound, and wartime madness, placed among what feels like dozens of great ones by the film’s end.
Nolan is the best watch-maker in the business, and there’s no greater showcase of his gifts for machination and cinema scholarship than Dunkirk. It’s been written that the director screened and studied films like Greed, Foreign Correspondent, Ryan’s Daughter, Saving Private Ryan, Speed, and even Unstoppable to find inspiration for his latest film. That syllabus and enthusiasm for film history shows in the execution of his film, but only the finest spare parts apply. His film has the visual palette of a Rembrandt, the fast and secure editing of a peak Tony Scott outing, the soulful stare and contemplative gaze of a great silent work from Murnau. And the 70mm photography? Unparalleled in 2017. Lean would blush. But it’s all Nolan; surprisingly taut, and utterly sincere.
Nolan, ever the ingenuity-driven cineaste, has gifted us with a ravishing, almost revolutionary style of big-budget filmmaking that amounts to the sum of some truly fine parts. It’s a master class in form, and a high mark for an already accomplished director. Sitting at the corner of complex art and popcorn adrenaline, Nolan has forged a seamless blend. By mixing technique, history, and thematic calls to action, here’s a classical-yet-modernist action film that will be taken apart and put on display in film schools and film clubs for years to come.","Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than 300 men in a line on a beach.
The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered to be music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene.
To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If you want the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where the main goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the content then keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truth for once.
Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obvious where that money went because these so called movie creators couldn't even be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships and planes to really set the scene.
There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corrupt enough to be used as the marketing tool.
"
,,"Never has the safety of home seemed so close and yet so tantalizingly, agonizingly far.

That’s the dilemma at the center of Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk.” The film tells the story of the massive, unlikely evacuation of British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops from a French beach at a crucial point in World War II that turned a defeat into something like victory, inspiring the Allies (and Winston Churchill, whose “we shall fight on the beaches” speech gets its proper due here).

But this being a Nolan film, it does so in its own idiosyncratic way.

Nolan is the best example of the filmmaker who, if you asked him what time it was would tell you how the watch works — and in his case that’s a compliment, because he turns the intricacies and minutiae of time and how it’s used in stories into artistic statements. Certainly he has done that here — “Dunkirk” is a great movie, both an old-time inspirational war epic and at the same time very much a Christopher Nolan movie. About 400,000 troops were stranded at Dunkirk, sitting ducks for the Germans (never mentioned by name; they’re just “the enemy”) who could strafe them by air at will. They could practically see the safety of the Dover cliffs, but had no way to reach them. Nolan tells the story from three perspectives: from the men on the beach, desperate to find their way to safety; from the air, where pilots engage in dogfights as the British try to keep some heat off of the stranded soldiers; and the mass of civilians who sailed to Dunkirk to help evacuate soldiers, as unlikely a fleet of saviors as one could imagine. But it’s not enough to simply alternate perspectives. Nolan also plays with time — perhaps not a surprise from the director of the backward-told “Memento” or the trippy “Inception.” But here it’s supremely effective. As he tells us in cards (there’s little dialogue to speak of in the entire film), the action on the beach takes about a week; in the boats a day; and one hour in the air.  He repeatedly shifts back and forth, not just among the stories but among time frames once he’s inside them. It should be maddening, and in the hands of a lesser director it would be. Instead it’s fascinating, building maximum tension between the stories, and the moments within them.

This is crucial. The outcome of Operation Dynamo, as the mission is called, is available in any history book, so the telling of the story becomes paramount. Nolan’s technique, aided greatly by Hans Zimmer’s incredibly effective score (at one point he incorporates a ticking stopwatch into a scene), ratchets up the tension from the opening and never relents.

The opening, in which a group of soldiers wander empty streets, quickly turns lethal, and the visuals are stunning — a mad sprint down an alley, a desperate climb over a wall, death everywhere.

The action in the air is stunning. Tom Hardy, his face covered by an oxygen mask and his voice garbled by his radio microphone, making his Bane in Nolan's “The Dark Knight Rises” sound like a master of elocution, is terrific as one of the pilots, using only his eyes to register the concentration, excitement, frustration and terror he’s feeling. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyle Van Hoytema put us in the cockpit (literally; they mounted a camera in a Spitfire), so we see the difficulty of getting the enemy in your sights, or the gamble of guessing how much fuel you have left once your gauge has been cracked. In the water, Mark Rylance is just as good as a father quietly doing what he believes is right — heading toward a war zone in his recreational boat, his son and son’s friend in tow. They’ll pick up a shell-shocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) who isn’t thrilled about the idea of going back to the hell from which he’s escaped.

On the ground, yes, Harry Styles can act. The former One Direction singer is quite good as one of three soldiers Nolan concentrates on, as they form an almost wordless bond, brought together by their desire to stay alive but keep running into obstacles that make that more difficult.

There are stories within these stories, and while there’s not a lot of exposition, Kenneth Branagh provides some as a naval officer who knows the numbers — of the 400,000 soldiers on the beach, Churchill hopes maybe 35,000 to 40,000 can be saved.

If Nolan at times has come off as a bit of a clinical technician, then the unironic amount of pure, old-fashioned inspiration he employs here may come as a surprise. It’s a welcome one, and perfectly appropriate. “Dunkirk” is a brilliant movie, Nolan’s best, and that’s saying something.","Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.

I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.

How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.

When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.

The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though.

So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.

I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it."
,,"From first frame to last, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is a monumental achievement, a World War II epic of staggering visual spectacle (see it in IMAX if you can) that hits you like a shot in the heart. Leave it to a filmmaking virtuoso at the peak of his powers to break both new ground and all the rules – who else would make a triumphant war film about a crushing Allied defeat? And who but Nolan, born in London to a British father and an American mother, would tackle WWII without America in it? 

The time is 1940, and the Yanks haven’t yet entered the hostilities. There are 400,000 British, French, Canadian and Belgian soldiers trapped on the beaches of a small French town called Dunkirk, all waiting to be evacuated before they’re wiped out by the might of Hitler on land, sea and air. The Allied troops are sitting ducks, caught in a vise of tension that the director makes throat-catchingly palpable on screen. It’s a brutal irony that the English Channel, a 26-mile stretch of water, is so close the British soldiers can squint and see home. But the water is too shallow for large rescue ships; only small boats and private yachts can get in. A miracle is needed in the form of a mini-armada manned by civilians. A miracle is what they get. Aside from Nolan’s 1998 feature debut Following, Dunkirk – at a tight, transfixing 106 minutes – is the shortest entry in the filmmaker’s back catalog. What the writer-director has done here, besides keeping dialogue to a minimum, is remove the backstory and cut to the chase. We’re right there in the battle and on the beaches, feeling what these young soldiers feel as they cope with the buzz of looming death and sudden blasts of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror. The ticking-clock urgency and immediacy takes your breath away. And if you thought Nolan screwed around with space and time in Memento and Inception, wait till you see the linear leaps he makes in this film so that audiences can see the same event from interlocking perspectives over an hour, a day, a week.

Newcomer Fionn Whitehead excels as Tommy, the movie’s universal soldier and the represention of all the raw recruits trapped on the beach. He joins up two other soldiers – Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) and Alex (Harry Styles, playing a small role with subtle grace and zero pop-star showboating). They want to make it to “the mole,” a pier where vessels await orders from naval Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and army Col. Winnant (James D’Arcy). It’s Tommy’s plan to gain access to a hospital ship. Naturally, what can go wrong does. Nolan never shows us the enemy; he makes the Nazis as abstract and suddenly lethal as they are to the men on the beach.

Meanwhile, in the air, Spitfire fighter planes are assigned to provide cover on the beach and shoot down Luftwaffe bombers. Dunkirk focuses most on Farrier, a Royal Air Force Spitfire pilot played by Tom Hardy, his face mostly hidden behind a mask (shades of Bane) but whose demeanor tells a complete story. The aerial sequences are like nothing you’ve ever seen, as Nolan hoists his cameras up through the cockpit and into the wild blue yonder, without the use of green screens or phony digital effects. You are right there in the middle of these dizzying dogfights, and the experience is both frightening and thrilling.

On the sea, we watch Dawson, played by Oscar winner Mark Rylance, maneuver his own yacht, the Moonstone, across the Channel, with the help of his son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and a local kid (Barry Keoghan) eager to join the fray. The boat crew picks up a shivering soldier (the excellent Cillian Murphy) whose ship has been torpedoed and whose eyes reflect a horror he can’t articulate. The cast is reliably superb, but this is not a film that needs or encourages star turns – it’s as fine and unselfish a display of ensemble acting as you’ll see anywhere.

Which is exactly as it should be. Nolan’s film is, above all, a
celebration of communal heroism – the “Dunkirk spirit” that enabled
these soldiers, despite heavy casualties, to fight another day. As the
new British Prime Minister Winston Churchill would later say, “Wars are
not won on evacuations.” Had Hitler pursued the fight on the beaches and
forced a surrender, we’d all be living a real version of The Man in the High Castle.

So it’s impossible to overstate the importance of this battle, especially to the people of Great Britain. To outsiders, especially here in Trump’s America, the significance might be lost – or even be counted as a spoiler. Nolan has changed all that with a film that speaks to soldiers and noncombatants working together to forge a bond out of suffering. Though the film is alive with action and Hitchcock-level suspense, the intimate moments are just as shattering. In contrast to the R-rated savagery of the Normandy invasion in Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan, the filmmaker takes a PG-13 approach that writes its story of the faces of those in the thick of it.

And in his attempt to record history realistically onscreen, Nolan rejects computer tricks in favor of practical effects, using thousands of extras and whatever boats and planes he could find from the era. The impact is incalculable and indelible. Cheers to camera wiz Hoyte van Hoytema, editor Lee Smith, composer Hans Zimmer (listen for the tick-tock in his score) and a next-level soundscape for sustaining a breakneck pace without losing the personal toll taken on its characters. This is not a film about politics or the major figures of the era (a Churchill speech is heard, but only as read by a soldier on the ground). In fact, Nolan argues that he hasn’t made a war film at all, but a story of survival. Point taken. But there’s little doubt that he has, without sentimentality or sanctimony, raised that genre to the level of art. Dunkirk is a landmark with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic. The Oscar race for Best Picture is officially on.","Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time."
,,"The notion of Christopher Nolan making a historically accurate World War II picture—especially one focused on the 1940 evacuation of Dunkirk, among the most mythologized events of the war in Nolan’s native England—didn’t sound promising. Nolan’s films, especially in his post–The Dark Knight phase, have often tended toward operatic maximalism. Whatever your opinion of Inception, his speculative sci-fi thriller from 2010, there’s no denying it was a movie that crammed an impressive lot in: a lot of big ideas, a lot of nested alternate realities and concurrent time loops, a lot of mind-bending visual effects. But for all its ambition and energy, I found Inception’s nonstop intensity and hammering soundtrack exhausting. The idea of a similarly grandiose re-enactment of one of military history’s largest-scale rescue operations seemed all but doomed to be elephantine. In addition, Nolan’s famously fertile imagination sounded potentially dangerous in combination with a true historical event incredible enough to require no dramatic embellishment. And that, my friends, will serve as my yearly reminder never to go into a movie with preconceived ideas. The swift-moving, pulse-pounding Dunkirk reveals its filmmaker at his most nimble, supple, and simple—all adjectives that seem strange to use in connection with a movie shot in 65 mm Imax format, using practical effects and real stunts to re-create such large-scale events as the sinking of a WWII destroyer and the attempted mass evacuation of more than 300,000 men. But Dunkirk’s simplicity inheres not in its production logistics but in its storytelling.

In a radical move, Dunkirk entirely does away with the narrative scaffolding that holds together most war pictures: the introduction, at boot camp or in battle, of a crew of soldierly comrades. The scenes of military higher-ups debating strategy over maps. The cutaways to families waiting back home or flashbacks to the combatants’ prewar days. Instead, the film plunges us straight in medias res, or rather in the middle of several different res: Dunkirk follows stories unfolding in three separate places not at the same time but in three overlapping time frames: one lasting a week, one a day, and one only an hour. The weeklong story takes place at and around “The Mole,” the name given to a ramshackle 8-foot-wide pier on Dunkirk beach on the French coast where the British forces have been trapped, along with their allies, by the advancing German army. Without either shelter or a port suitable for large-scale evacuation, the hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the beach are open targets for bombing runs—and as the Navy commander in charge (Kenneth Branagh) is well-aware, the presence of British forces on the beach at Dunkirk, however imperiled, represents the last bulwark against the Nazi invasion of the British mainland.

Cut to time frame two, “The Sea” (these section titles flash on the screen only once, after which the three separate stories intermix freely). Here, on the English side of the channel, a quiet middle-aged man called only Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) is readying his small wooden pleasure boat, the Moonstone, for a trip that sounds anything but pleasurable. Along with his teenage son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney), Mr. Dawson has decided to answer his country’s call for a fleet of civilian seagoing crafts to help ferry the trapped soldiers to safety in their home country. At the last minute, Peter’s naïve friend George (Barry Keoghan) decides to join the expedition as well. Not long after setting sail, this group picks up a shell-shocked survivor (Cillian Murphy) from the wreck of a torpedoed ship. Against this unnamed soldier’s fierce objections, the Moonstone crew plows on, taking him back toward the hell he’s only just managed to escape.

Time frame three, “The Air,” takes place in an hour above the beaches and waters of the English Channel. Two crack Royal Air Force fighter pilots, Collins (Jack Lowden) and Farrier (Tom Hardy), fly a series of strategic sorties, attempting to pick off the Luftwaffe planes that keep arriving to strafe the escape boats below. At times the pilots’ flight paths intersect with the stories of the soldiers and civilians attempting to find safe passage, lending the battle scenes at sea an extra layer of dramatic irony. When you know the identity of both rescuer and rescue-ee, the welcome swooping-in of Allied planes signals not only that help is on the way, but that the brave men in the cockpits may be about to give their lives to provide it.

The degree to which the viewer does or does not “get to know” the characters in this intimate yet somehow impersonal movie may be a point of contention among audiences. Dunkirk is a portrait of a military and humanitarian operation more than it is a study of a group of individuals. It isn’t that big on characterization or, for that matter, dialogue—a good deal of which is inaudible thanks to the near-constant cacophony of plane crashes, gunfire, and explosions. And the closest thing this ensemble piece has to a protagonist—a very young soldier played by Fionn Whitehead—is not only nearly silent but sometimes difficult to distinguish from two of his fellow survivors (Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles), especially when they’re covered in oil and grime from the various bombed and capsized ships they’ve abandoned.

Though this movie brims with scarily immersive you-are-there action (captured by Hoyte van Hoytema’s mysteriously mobile-yet-unshaky handheld Imax camera and soundtracked by Hans Zimmer’s braaamm-less yet effective score), it works on the emotions in a different way than most war movies. The event it documents—sometimes referred to as the Miracle of Dunkirk—was, in strictly military terms, the opposite of a victory. Evacuating the beach was the Allies’ last remotely possible escape from a rout so complete that the Allies’ only hope was to try to stay alive long enough for the next battle. But it was also, for those civilian seagoers called on to aid in the effort, the only and obvious right thing to do. Most of the people whose paths cross on the fateful week, day, and hour chronicled in Dunkirk are strangers to one another. Their only goal—which, with a few ugly exceptions, they struggle toward together—is to keep one another alive long enough to get safely home. Rylance’s performance as the modest but courageous Mr. Dawson captures the heroism of such everyday civic virtue without a spare word or gesture, as Mark Rylance performances are wont to do. And the fact that most of the actors playing soldiers are not only relative unknowns but baby-faced near-teenagers drives home with extra force our foreknowledge that the war to come will reap so many more unknown young lives.

","Crow the critics are about Nolan's latest, ""Dunkirk."" A stunning masterpiece say many. Masterpiece my ass.

Snookered by the hype and war film fandom, ducats were placed on counter, a ticket for admission passed back. Lights dimmed, anticipation mounted, and... nothing. Nothing. Save lurching between disparate, battle set pieces featuring people for whom little or no empathy exists. Lacking investment in the characters, what remains are merely adequate, bloodless war scenes easily outgunned by the recent ""Fury"" and, farther back, ""Saving Private Ryan."" For example, a young boy is killed but we know nothing of him, nothing of his motivation for climbing aboard a civilian, Dunkirk-bound boat at the last minute. We feel nothing for him because he's simply a cardboard cutout.

As the actors barely register emotion, boredom set in and not to be shaken off. The characters move as wind-up toys. There are few actors who bare their soul like Cillian Murphy, here a shell-shocked survivor. As directed, he sleepwalks with the depth of an amateur in a high school production. He's not alone. All the actors turn in measured performances with identical blank looks and monotone deliveries. Particularly wasted is the actor's actor, Kenneth Branagh.

Certainly the bravery and sacrifice of civilian and military in the Dunkirk evacuation is celebrated in ""Dunkirk."" Thank you. However, this historical action occurred in 1940. Films echo the zeitgeist of the time in which they're produced. It's an odd choice to make a large (bad) film about an evacuation three-quarters of a century past. There's a stink of political agenda afoot in ""Dunkirk"" that's intolerable. The enemy, unseen in ""Dunkirk,"" lurks and kills from safety by air and ground. Surrounded with backs to the the Atlantic, the very survival of a way of life is in question, as portrayed in ""Dunkirk."" (Spoiler Alert: The Allies Won The War.) The enemy's attacks are isolated like terrorism. The result is ""Dunkirk"" weaves a cautionary allegory mirroring religious extremism bent on destroying all non-believers.

Subtle propaganda is dangerous. ""Dunkirk"" fits that bill. Either that or Nolan is a complete idiot who hasn't a whit of sense. It's a toss-up based on a filmography including the lackluster borefest ""Interstellar,"" and the beyond inane ""Inception.""

Nolan remains static in his career with ""Dunkirk."" His films are half-baked, underwritten, detached, and emotion-free. ""Dunkirk"" plays like a rough cut by a bad director who expects the viewer to emotionally fill-in-the-blanks. ""Dunkirk"" even lacks the courage of its convictions in being bloodless - there are no graphic deaths. At least Spielberg had the courage to rub the viewer's nose in the stench of death in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The first half hour of that film is unprecedented in the depiction of carnage (one can almost taste the grit of raining sand from nearby mortar strikes). Nolan sanitizes-for-your-own-protection. Yet he chose a violent topic and punked out; a war movie detached from death is not a film about war. By design, war cannot include gratuitous violence, just insanity - an element also lacking in ""Dunkirk.""

The wall-to-wall dramatic, but mixed low, score loses its effectiveness and becomes annoying. And, the constant, ham-handed crosscutting between stories further waters this already thin soup by stopping a scene's dramatic momentum.

A short scene in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942) featuring civilian Walter Pidgeon returning from Dunkirk in his shot up runabout says more in the visuals and a few lines of dialogue about the evacuation than the entirety of ""Dunkirk."" As Trump might Tweet, ""Sad!"""
Get Out,Oscar,"his fantastically twisted and addictively entertaining horror-satire on the subject of race plays like an Ira Levin rewrite of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. I can imagine Drew Goddard or Sam Fuller wanting to direct it. In fact, it is written and directed by Jordan Peele, whose recent movie Keanu, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his longtime comedy partner Keegan-Michael Key struck me as a bit lame. And to my embarrassment I knew nothing of their . Well, this is a hypnotically nasty gem. British actor Daniel Kaluuya is Chris, the black boyfriend of Rose, a beautiful young white woman played by Allison Williams (from Lena Dunham’s series Girls). They’ve dating for a few months and she plans to take Chris back to her family home to meet her hugely wealthy and excruciatingly liberal parents Dean and Missy (wonderfully played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener), a surgeon and psychotherapist, respectively. Rose predicts that her embarrassingly well-meaning dad will assure Chris that he would have voted for Obama a third time if that was possible. But when Chris arrives at their colossal home, he is deeply disconcerted to find that Rose’s family, though impeccably progressive, are surrounded by black staff, who lock eyes with the family’s honoured guest with glacial correctness. (Watching the movie, I found myself thinking of Michael Gove’s legendary, gushing description of arriving for his interview with Donald Trump last year: he was “whisked up to the president-elect’s office in a lift plated with reflective golden panels and operated by an immensely dignified African-American attendant kitted out in frock coat and white gloves.”)

It so happens that the young couple’s visit coincides with a big family get together, and the hospitality becomes more and more unsettling. Get Out is very creepy, very funny and as pitiless as a surgeon’s scalpel.","Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing and saying the things that white people say to black people in an attempt to prove they aren't racist.

The movie was fairly well acted despite not having exceptionally strong material to work with. I thought Daniel Kaluuya turned in a really strong performance and he really saved the movie, imo. I don't recall seeing him in anything else prior to this, but he gave an excellent performance and I hope this serves as a spring board to bigger/better roles. Seems very talented.

My biggest problem with this movie is that I don't know what it was trying to be. It kind of hit a little bit with the satire and humor elements, but all in all, the movie just doesn't really have an identity. The ""mystery"" behind everything was not well concealed and the twists and turns you'd expect from a movie like this just never developed. I had this movie pretty well figured out before the halfway mark, which made for a less enjoyable second half of the movie. I'm pretty amazed by all the rave reviews it's getting.

It is a bit groundbreaking in it's own right strictly for the cultural/social/racial aspect - as that has been largely neglected in movies, especially this genre - but once you get passed that and just look at the movie for what it is, I can't really give this movie anything more than a middling grade. Not the worst movie I've ever seen by any means, but also not really worth the price of admission either. Wait for it to come out on Netflix and enjoy from the comfort of your own couch."
,,"After its Sundance premiere, the low budget (reportedly just $5m) outing over-achieved wildly in its North American opening, grossing an estimated $30.5m this weekend through worldwide distributor Universal. The numbers might not be quite so impressive as the film rolls out internationally through the spring, though Kaluuya and the topical theme should still make for some above-average grosses.

Kaluuya (best known for UK TV series including Skins and Babylon) plays Chris, an African-American photographer from New York nervously setting out with Caucasian girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams, from HBO’s Girls) to meet her parents over a weekend at the family’s country estate.

Rose’s psychiatrist mother (played by Catherine Keener) and neurosurgeon father Dean (Bradley Whitford) give the new boyfriend an apparently warm welcome – with Dad noting his admiration for President Obama - but there’s something odd about Rose’s brother (Caleb Landry Jones) and the family’s black housekeeper (Betty Gabriel) and black groundsman (Marcus Henderson).

Things get stranger still when the guests – almost all of them older white folks - turn up for a family party at which Chris turns out, in more ways than one, to be the centre of attention.

Peele, who also wrote the script, is best known as partner to Keegan-Michael Key on Comedy Central sketch show Key & Peele (the two also starred in recent big screen action spoof Keanu) and there are bits of comedy throughout the film, most of them delivered by Chris’s suspicious best friend and ultimate saviour Rod (LilRel Howery).

For the most part, however, the film’s build-up is quietly creepy, with the feel of vintage thrillers from the seventies like The Wicker Man and The Stepford Wives. The final act gets more visceral, and while there are a few heavy-handed moments the action has a refreshing vigour and a crowd-pleasing outcome.

The social comment is there from the start – when a young black man gets paranoid walking the streets of a middle-class suburb – but it’s delivered with a light hand and mostly takes a back seat to the genre tropes. Kaluuya’s engaging performance does a lot to make the mix shocks and commentary work, which bodes well for his upcoming turns in Marvel’s Black Panther and Steve McQueen’s Widows.","""Get Out"" takes the initial premise of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and then twists it with ""The Stepford Wives"" to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn't arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn't taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They're a lost cause. Instead, he's looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, ""Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn't work for them?""

The film is genuinely creepy. Instead of cheesy music and grotesque torture porn, Peele relies on the unknown to draw you in. What is happening here? The plot builds like a slow boil to a terror explosion. Clues to the outcome are evident from the first second, but it takes the entire run-time to pull everything together. It's such a joy to be surprised by a horror outcome. I don't think I've seen a genre film this inventive since Cabin in the Woods. The resolve is truly satisfying.

My favourite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There's a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes; the characters aren't morons. I cringe every time I watch a genre film and the characters don't behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is amiss, enough to warrant wariness. Anyone in this situation would be unnerved as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally.

""Get Out"" doesn't replace the scares with humour – Peele is too smart to do that. Instead, he balances the fear with laughs and then laces everything with social comment and that unsettling tone. The fact that Chris is so eminently likable just underlines it. It all adds up to something of a treat – for everybody, not just horror fans."
,," And she’s not wrong: When the couple roll up to the faux-modest zillion-dollar family homestead, mom and dad (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, perfectly cast as members of that substrata, the scruffy rich) greet Chris at the door by wrapping him in their arms. “We’re huggers!” dad announces, hearty and innocent in his very squareness. It all seems fine, but groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson) and housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel) eye Chris warily: He’s “like” them, but not, and both he and they know it. Chris chats with them amiably, making every effort to cross the shaky bridge of class, of education, of something, that separates them. But they’re cold and strange in return, and he isn’t sure how to read that. Even though all self-proclaimed progressive people like to think we’re comfortable talking about racial divisions in America, we’re really not. And that’s what makes Get Out—in addition to being an unsettling, and occasionally very funny, thriller—pretty close to a work of genius. As one half of the dazzling comedy duo Key and Peele—the other half is Keegan-Michael Key—Peele has always been attuned to thorny race-related questions. Why is it that well-intentioned white people who try so hard to be attuned to “the black experience” can be so deeply annoying? And even though we should all be accepting of interracial relationships, there can be misgivings on either side. Peele—who also wrote the script—wrestles with all of those ideas, and much more. His movie is sardonic but never bitter. He’s inquisitive but never sour-spirited—he prefers asking questions to scoring points.

But if there’s a lot to unpack in Get Out, there’s also pure pleasure to be had just in watching the plot unfold—you never quite know where Peele is going next. This is inventive and lively horror filmmaking: Peele uses simple elements—a taxidermied deer’s head hanging on a paneled wall, an old-style console TV set—to build a sinister suburban-Gothic mood: It’s as if the world of affluent white people, with its status symbols and self-congratulatory broad-mindedness, were itself a kind of dark magic, impenetrable and at least vaguely untrustworthy—not to mention very, very uncool.

And while the last thing you generally look for in a horror film is terrific acting, Get Out is loaded with it. Kaluuya’s Chris, handsome and sweet, is the quintessential great boyfriend, working hard to connect with Rose’s family in spite of the unwitting insults they keep dropping: He’s instantly sympathetic, the guy whose side you’re on no matter what. Lil Rel Howery, as Chris’s best friend (and stalwart TSA officer) Rod, steps in with breezy comic relief just when the movie needs it. Even the actors in smaller roles—like Gabriel, as housekeeper Georgina—spin subtle spells: You’re never sure if these characters are malevolent or just understandably resentful, but by the end, when you’ve put all the pieces together, you begin to understand just how delicately calibrated these performances are. They’re all part of a picture that asks difficult questions and offers no easy answers. Get Out is the movie for the world we live in today. If we stop thinking, we’re dead.“I wanna be black,” Lou Reed once sang, reflecting the largely unspoken feelings of many white people everywhere. The addendum, of course, is that there are some white people who want to be as cool as black people but without having to suffer any of the bigotry and oppression. That’s just one of the many potent subthreads of Get Out, Jordan Peele’s extraordinary and genuinely creepy directorial debut. Peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail: He’s made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that you’re laughing even as you’re thinking, and vice-versa.

Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a successful and respected photographer, treks out to an extraordinarily white enclave—it’s so town-and-country chichi, and so remote, that it doesn’t even qualify as the suburbs—to meet his girlfriend’s family. Rose (Alison Williams) is the cool girlfriend everyone wants, so it only makes sense that she’d land a cool boyfriend like Chris. Before the two head out on their sojourn, Chris asks, hesitantly, if she has told her family that he’s black. She replies that she hasn’t, but that he shouldn’t worry: Her dad is sure to blurt out that he’d have voted for Obama a third time if he could, but that’s just because he’s “a lame dad.” Her parents, she insists adamantly, are not racists.

","I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).

Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man (and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel ""sorry"" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.

The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.

In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"
,,"Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a twentysomething photographer in an unnamed city, is heading to the suburbs with his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), to meet her parents—and she hasn’t told them that Chris is black. From this premise, the writer and director Jordan Peele (of Key and Peele) develops a brilliantly satirical horror comedy that pierces the sensitive points of American race relations with surgical precision and destroys comforting illusions with radical ferocity. A pre-credit scene sets up the looming violence, though nothing seems further from the warm embrace with which Rose’s parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford), a neurosurgeon, and Missy (Catherine Keener), a psychiatrist, welcome Chris. Still, he is puzzled by the remote and ironic behavior of the family’s help, Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and Walter (Marcus Henderson), who are black. A teeming party scene reveals prosperous white folks’ genteel prejudices as well as hints that something deeper is amiss in their paradise—something like involuntary servitude—and Chris’s best friend, Rod (Lil Rel Howery), suspects trouble, even as ingenious dream sequences conjure Chris’s own forebodings. Peele’s perfectly tuned cast and deft camera work unleash his uproarious humor along with his political fury; with his first film, he’s already an American Buñuel.","I was totally blown away by ""Get Out"". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited ""fish out of the water"" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. ""Get out"" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."
,,"In the opening moments of Get Out, as a mysterious, threatening figure stalks a wary black man who’s lost his way in a suburban neighborhood at night, writer-director Jordan Peele declares his intentions in two clear ways. First: he openly invokes the death of Trayvon Martin, a black 17-year-old killed in a gated community by a man who assumed he was a criminal because of his skin color. Second: Peele lets the scene play out like a familiar horror movie sequence, complete with stabbing musical jump-cues, canny tension-building camera movement, and sudden, shocking action. Like the equally memorable opening scene of the recent horror movie It Follows, the initial moments of Get Out are a reminder that no matter how domestic and low-key the film becomes at other times, it’s first and foremost a horror movie, with an agenda of unsettling the audience, then scaring the hell out of them. But it’s also an overtly political movie, one that evokes current racial tensions both to make the story more relevant, and to make it more frightening.

Get Out is specific and pointed about white privilege and power and the inequities it creates, not just on a broad societal level, but in situations as small as social gatherings and casual conversations. There’s a lot of comic potential in the ideas Peele plays with here, in the possibility that any given racially tinged awkwardness between strangers might just be insensitivity, or might mask something much darker and more savage. But there’s a lot of paralyzing terror in that idea, too. For Peele’s protagonist, a talented black photographer named Chris Washington (played by Daniel Kaluuya, star of the standout Black Mirror episode “Fifteen Million Merits”), being able to tell the difference is literally a life-or-death proposition. From the start, Peele uses racial tension to crank up the narrative tension. When Chris’ white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) invites him to meet her parents at their beautifully appointed, isolated lake house in a rich suburb, he hedges. She hasn’t told her parents he’s black, and he anticipates a potentially uncomfortable scene. But her folks, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), are welcoming and friendly. Dean is an awkwardly forceful would-be liberal ally — among other things, he claims he wanted to vote for Obama for a third term, and brags about what an honor it was when his father lost a potential Olympic competition slot to Jesse Owens. But otherwise, the entire Armitage family seems genial enough. Still, Chris is unnerved by the alternating aggression and beaming artificiality of the Armitages’ black housekeeper and groundskeeper, Walter and Georgina (Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel, who deliver memorably eerie performances). As the family hosts an annual gathering, the aging white guests pile up the microaggressions, taking every opportunity to grope Chris’ muscles without asking, or to pointedly, proudly mention their admiration for Tiger Woods. And many more significant bizarre events leave Chris wondering whether something inimical is going on, or he’s just being paranoid.

Peele has a great deal of fun teasing the audience with that question, and riding the line between horror and humor. Chris periodically checks in with his black buddy Rod (Lil Rel Howery), a comic-relief character who punctures the tension and lampshades Chris’ anxieties with rants suitable for a stand-up set. (“White people love making people sex slaves and shit!” he bellows at Chris. Then he launches into a speech about Jeffrey Dahmer’s fetishes that’s pure transgressive comedy.) But when Rod isn’t easing the strain, Peele jacks it up to nerve-wracking levels. The film’s title has a specific place in the narrative, but it’s also perfectly suited for a film where most viewers will be thinking “Get out of there!” at Chris as of about 15 minutes into the movie.

The plot ultimately owes a lot to a well-known 1970s thriller that can’t be named without spoiling Get Out’s most significant twists. But other paranoid thrillers come into play as well, from M. Night Shyamalan’s recent “something’s not right” thriller The Visit to the terrific original 1973 version of The Wicker Man, where a detective investigates a child’s disappearance while fatally misunderstanding the situation. Like the best conspiracy thrillers, Get Out piles up uncomfortable situations and unsettling images to keep the audience off base, but keeps the mysteries unraveling steadily almost until the final moments. That’s part of what makes it such a strong debut: conspiracy movies usually fall apart in the final act, but as Get Out progresses, it keeps revealing new depths to Peele’s craft. The script is tremendously taut and thought-through, with minor details from the early going constantly revealing new significance. The cast is perfectly pitched and playing to their strengths, with Whitford and Keener in particular both making use of their ability to underline geniality with a hint of menace. In particular, Peele and Kaluuya make Chris a sympathetic and developed character, but they never lose track of his iconic status as a stand-in for every modern unarmed black motorist or pedestrian dealing with coded racism from the police, and wondering whether the situation is about to turn lethal. An early scene involving a policeman, whom Chris defers to and Rose defies, evokes white privilege and identity politics effectively enough to be excruciating. It’s one of many scenes that stands on its own — but it also has a meaningful part to play in the story.

It’s significant that Chris starts out as a passive, quiet, conflict-averse man who defers to white authority in every form. Peele has said that his target with Get Out was primarily the white liberal elite, the types who think President Obama’s election and their own open-mindedness have solved racism. And he’s unsparing in mocking them, in terms of making his antagonists not just ruthless, but laughable. Still, Peele spares a little side-eye for Chris, who’s willing to go along with anything to avoid causing trouble, and gets himself in trouble as a result. The entire film is about Chris coming to terms with his need to defend himself, to fight back, and to trust his instincts about who’s a threat, no matter how congenially they tell him that black skin is “in fashion” at the moment.

Like so much of Key & Peele’s comedy, Get Out is refreshing in its naked, frank aggression about confronting racial issues, with comedy, drama, and sharp, unsparing insight. The film isn’t subtle about how unhappy Chris is to be the only black person in a crowd, or how relieved he is to share his worries with a black friend. Peele doesn’t disguise the story’s application to current social fears about cultural appropriation and assimilation, or about prejudice, abuse of power, and the reckless, unchecked use of authority that produced casualties like Darrien Hunt, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. And by acknowledging the tension, he builds a platform to channel it all into tense, morbid terror. In the process, he creates one of the decade’s most openly meaningful horror films, and also one of its hands-down scariest.","I finished watching Get Out over 2 hours ago, but something has been bothering me since the credits rolled. A sort of unpleasant, irritated feeling that I couldn't really put my finger on until now. My biggest complaint about this horror film is that it's not actually as scary as the real life social problems it constantly hammers the viewer over the head with. It's campy jump scares and unbelievable premise, drown out the anti-racist message it could have had. In that way, it fails both as a horror movie and constructive social commentary.

Most quality horror movies take real life events and intensify them to create something terrifying but relatable. The Shining was much scarier than my trip to Colorado. The Blair Witch Project was more intense than my last hike. Psycho was slightly more unnerving than my last stay at a motel.

Modern racism and the history of slavery are among the most disturbing and evil aspects of the human experience and something countless people suffer from daily. It is real and it is scary. So why add B-movie brain swaps and fortune-teller hypnosis? Why base the story on a cheesy fictional premise instead of something that actually happens? Why make all but two of the characters completely one dimensional? (Keep in mind, that Chris and his friend are the only characters in the film with both a conscience and their original brain, all others are lacking one or the other). Why does a flashing light reverse brain transplants? Why would a racist white family, lure black men to them by using their own daughter as a sex object? The answer to all these questions is lazy writing.

If you want to create a jarring horror movie rife with social commentary about racism at least root it in reality. Sadly, past and present, there is no lack of inspiration. I get that this movie is a very heavy handed allusion to slavery, but of all the awful things white people have done to black people, goofy brain swapping business isn't one of them.

I don't get why this movie has such overwhelmingly positive reviews. The cinematography and acting were good, but the plot was trite, compared to all the different directions they could have taken it. The idea of a racially charged horror movie with a black protagonist and white ghouls sounds really interesting (why I wanted to see it), but Get Out just takes that idea and slaps it onto a 50's B-flick."
,,"As at odds as they may initially appear, comedy and horror share a lot of DNA, particularly in their reliance on timing to evoke a physical response. A pause can either prolong the tension or make a simple sentence even funnier. Rhythm lets the audience know what to expect — or throws them off intentionally, creating an even bigger reaction. A scene — or entire film — may deliver its laughs or frights sparingly at first, only to increase momentum in its final moments. But even with all that said, the horror movie “Get Out” still feels like a revelation coming from sketch comedian and first-time director Jordan Peele. This satire is a masterful exercise in tension that doesn’t shy away from brutal violence, but it always knows exactly when to break that anxiety and terror with a perfectly executed joke. In its five seasons of sketches, “Key And Peele” never hesitated to go dark, and that instinct serves Peele well here in his first film behind the camera. Many of the show’s funniest bits had an undercurrent that revealed the worst of humanity, at once heightening the humor as well as causing the themes to linger. Peele and his co-creator Keegan-Michael Key attacked a variety of targets over nearly 300 sketches, but the comedy was best known for — and best at — its skewering of racial prejudice. “Get Out” continues that work, without ever feeling like a rehash of what fans have previously seen.

 In “Get Out,” Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a 26-year-old black man who is uneasy about traveling to meet the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams). She assures him that he has nothing to worry about: “They are not racist. I would have told you.” However, from the moment Rose’s dad (Bradley Whitford) greets him with a “My man,” Chris feels uncomfortable in the remote house. The presence of the eerily obedient black maid (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson) doesn’t make him feel better. Rose’s psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) seems friendly, but she may have hypnotized him without his permission. Each interaction escalates his discomfort, culminating in the world’s most awkward party with the family’s all-white group of friends and a lone black man (Lakeith Stanfield) who is acting strangely. Calls home to his best friend (LilRel Howery) only elevate his suspicions, but is Chris paranoid or is there danger lurking for him on the grounds of the isolated, seemingly perfect home?

“Get Out” layers its horrors. It’s not above an effective jump scare, but those are scattered amidst a mood of growing unease abetted by Toby Oliver‘s cinematography, particularly his sense of framing. Dialogue that might seem innocuous in another film or setting has the power to make you flinch here. The unsettling score from newcomer Michael Abels uses traditional screeching strings, which are complemented by songs with unnerving choral arrangements that start an itch deep in your brain. But what’s most frightening is the echoes of the real world in the terror presented on screen. Yes, the revelations of the plot are ultimately (hopefully) unrealistic, but the culture that created them is far too real and feels more evident than ever over the last few months, as hate has felt freer to show itself. This isn’t a satire that feels over-the-top during most of the characters’ conversations. Instead, they seem like the sometimes well-intentioned, if entirely awful, things that are said to people of color on a regular basis.

Horror has often delved into the urbanites’ fears of the rural, from “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” to “You’re Next,” but Peele’s personal experience adds an additional level of terror and depth here. This isn’t just uncertainty of the unknown and wide open spaces; it’s discomfort based in historical and ongoing context. This is one of the reasons why we need diversity in voices in the genre (and beyond): different experiences in life can lead to different fears, meaning that we don’t just get the same frights over and over again on screen. For all its heavy themes and moments of discomfort, “Get Out” has a surprisingly light touch, thanks to Peele’s work as both director and screenwriter. Movies with this serious a message about race are rarely fun to watch, but Peele has a perfect handle on tone, knowing just when to lean toward menacing, eerie or sharply funny and when to tip things in another direction. This is a major filmmaking debut that’s fully worthy of all the conversation it will start, both around its commentary on race in America and how truly good it is. [A-]","The premise for Get Out is interesting and makes for an unusual horror. The premise, although good, deteriorates into clichés by the end, never fully fleshing out any of the characters and injecting humour where it doesn't really fit. The opening credits (and song) are haunting and evocative but the film itself portrays the characters as one dimensional. All of the white characters are evil and all of the black characters are victim. As usual, in Americas depiction of race, there is no middle ground, only white and black; no biracial, no latino, no Native American, only one Asian character randomly thrown in.

Although the film itself was fine if not rewatchable, what disturbed me most was sitting in an audience of black movie goers who cheered the deaths of all white people and made horrible comments.

As a horror lover, I have never seen even the worst killer or on-screen murder cheered, and yet the audience lapped it up because white people were being killed (even if they were the villains). This unsettled me. I'm not American and so my countries issues with race are not on par with Americas. To see the audience react this way felt odd, as if I had been transported to America. I almost feel like the film set race relations back! Ultimately, an interesting horror but more of a 'cheap shot' at evil ol' Whitey. The depths are never really explored."
,," This is the essence of Get Out, which only grows more darkly relevant as the main story gets going, masterfully unfurling all of the real-life anxieties of Existing While Black while simultaneously mining that situation for all its twisted absurdity. Rising English actor Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a photographer who is about to embark on a weekend trip in upstate New York to meet his white girlfriend’s family for the first time. This girlfriend, Rose, is played by Girls’ Allison Williams, whose on-screen persona as one of the foremost basic Beckys of the millennial generation has never before been put to such pitch-perfect use. And so it’s no surprise that Chris is a bit worried that she hasn’t mentioned to her parents that her boyfriend is black, or that she’s utterly oblivious to his concerns, insisting that “they are not racist.” (After all, she explains, her dad would have voted for Barack Obama a third time if he could have.)


If you’ve seen Rosemary’s Baby, The Stepford Wives, or Night of the Living Dead—all touchstones that Peele has cited as influences on his screenplay—you probably have a good idea of where things go from here. When Chris and Rose arrive, her parents’ estate is a mansion-size symbol of white affluence buried deep in the woods, while their zombielike black groundskeeper and maid seem to be possessed by the spirit of Uncle Tom. Peele puts the audience directly into Chris’ shoes as he navigates this new world that is at once utterly strange and all too familiar to him. He’s accustomed to the kind of casual racism tossed off by every white person he meets that weekend, whether it’s from Rose’s family or the prying guests that stop by for the family’s (initially) mysterious annual gathering. (“Is it true? Is it … better?” an older lady asks Rose immediately after fondling Chris’ biceps.) Yet he’s bewildered by the uncanny subservience of the only other black people he encounters. “It’s like they missed the movement,” Chris confides over the phone to his best friend Rod, a TSA agent, when he is able to slip away from the crowd. (As Rod, The Carmichael Show star Lil Rel Howery expertly serves as both comic relief and a surrogate for black audience members, warning Chris about the dangers of being around too many white people in an unfamiliar environment.) Peele also draws inspiration from Stanley Kubrick, most obviously when the man in the opening scene compares the suburban streets to “a fucking hedge maze,” but also in the hallucinatory scenes in which Chris is placed under hypnosis by Rose’s psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener), which feature images of Chris tumbling off into space that are soundtracked by micropolyphonic chanting reminiscent of the Györgi Ligety music Kubrick used in 2001: A Space Odyssey. But for all its nods to its horror forebears, Get Out, above all, wants to ensure that you walk away knowing that the black experience can still teeter on the precipice of being a nightmare, even in 2017. That even surface-level “admiration” for black culture on the part of white people can give way to insidious interactions that are, at best, a persistent annoyance black people must learn to laugh off, and, at worst, the kind of fetishization that only conceals deadlier preconceptions.

This tension is nothing new for Peele, who, alongside frequent comedic partner Keegan-Michael Key, mined this fertile territory repeatedly over five seasons of their hit Comedy Central show. Upon the release of last year’s Keanu, the duo’s sendup of both action-movie clichés and stereotypes about black masculinity, fans and critics wondered if the duo’s sharp wit, so tightly packaged in five-minute sketches, could sustain a feature-length film. Reviews were mixed and box office modest, though Keanu seems destined to become a cult classic. I anticipate that the fate of Get Out, which is Peele’s directorial debut, will be very different and will more closely mirror the massive cultural impact of Key & Peele. The movie currently holds a very rare 100 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and at the packed screening I attended, the mostly black audience responded rapturously and knowingly throughout Chris’ ordeal. In hitting that sweet spot between scary and hilarious, and laying bare the many layers of America’s historic treatment of the black body, Get Out could soon land an enduring spot on the syllabi of many a college course, alongside both Rosemary’s Baby and Between the World and Me.You need no more than a passing knowledge of horror movie tropes to immediately recognize the opening scene of writer-director Jordan Peele’s horror satire Get Out. And you need no more than a passing awareness of the past five years’ news cycle—or what it’s like to inhabit a black body in America—to immediately recognize the way in which Peele cleverly repurposes those tropes. A young black man (perennial scene-stealer Lakeith Stanfield) walks down the dimly lit sidewalk of a quiet suburban street, fumbling around on his cellphone for directions to his destination. A white car suddenly appears and begins to creep alongside him, gently playing the 1939 novelty song “Run, Rabbit, Run” by English comedy duo Flanagan and Allen. Instantly, his defenses are triggered. “Nope. Not today,” he mutters anxiously to himself, turning back the other way. “You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here.” But, not unlike the black teen whose name became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, he can’t avoid trouble. A masked individual exits the vehicle, attacks, and drags him toward the car.

","Someone remembers the movie Skeleton Key (2005, with Kate Hudson!)!? Well, Get Out is basically the same plot, whereas in Skeleton Key the transferring of the soul or whatever is done with black magic in Skeleton Key a neurosurgical procedure gets the job done. So the plot is mostly (besides the well-done clash of black and white folks culture) a copy cat (as Skeleton Key plays in the deep South we got also a little of the element of black/white culture contrasting).

If I would have to choose one of both movies for a cinematic night I would watch Skeleton Key again - the dark atmosphere is far more superior and the suspense also. Also, the end is far more delicate.

Get Out has some strong points - good actors, good production and especially the strange circumstances and the growing paranoia of our hero are well done.

On the other side, the movie has some weak points too - imo the (re)solution is hasty done, also there are some (important) mistakes - how our hero got the stuff into his ears, as he was bound to the chair!? And the brother didn't see the stuff in his ears - he was clearly checking if the ""sheep"" is asleep and knocked out. Also didn't our bad girl see (in darkness!) the blitz of the phone - she should know that the possession/control or whatever of the host is broken, so she would never give the gun to her ""grandfather"". Also the comedy- element is a mixed up experience - some of the subtle comedy elements I liked, tiresome for me was the black buddy stuff cliché: comedy Kitsch zillion times done before - it was (partly) funny with Eddie Murphy in the 80s and maybe you got away with it in the 90s but now...

And whereas a good horror-movie mostly has a bad end for the hero (Kate Hudson loses in a certain, surprising kind of way the struggle for her life), the director didn't have the guts to make a ""good"" end - ofc our hero should be shot by a cop or ride the electrical chair.

Why!? Because the mad comrades of our good evil family would ofc ""delete"" all pieces of evidence of crime there will be just one solution left - our black guy would be sentenced for mass murder, or who would believe his story, as many ""decent"" white folks would testify against him!? Btw - isn't that the point of a racist society!? ;)

This p.c.-ending is imo too much of fishing for compliments or sucking up to the common mainstream agenda - and a good horror movie should everything but be p.c.

In short - I was entertained and I like many aspects of the movie (especially all the actors), but in my horror collection Get Out won't make it into the top 100, maybe top 250 but even that's not for sure. The script/the story just is not good enough. Get Out: a little ""horror"" snack (the horror-elements are just a few, it's more a comedy and thriller). Not more but no less. Because all this biased overrating I rated 1, my real rate is 5.

note:imo the political agenda or bias of many of the reviewers and the votings (with black actors as main characters) is ridiculous - masterpieces like Blade Runner got a rating of 8.2 or Apocalypse Now one of 8.5 and Get Out got 8.1... I've become accustomed to subtract 2 to up to 3 points (deciding if I watch or not) if a black actor is involved as the main character(s) - not because of racism but because the ratings are f***ed up and I can't trust them (like all those fake reviews and ratings in the beginning of any movie initiated by the studios) - Get Out is just another proof of this hysteria."
,," The spirit of Ira Levin is alive and well in “Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s impressive feature debut as a writer-director. Levin was best known for novels like “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Stepford Wives,” chilling little tales in which a seemingly posh and prosperous community was hiding something truly terrifying.

That’s the vibe that Peele nails so successfully. On their sketch show “Key & Peele,” he and comedy partner Keegan-Michael Key were masters at finding the humor in the uncomfortable gulf between male and female, black and white, gay and straight, nerdy and cool; here, there’s a similar mining of everyday absurdities and injustice, only it’s in the service of a tightly-wound horror film.

In the same way that “The Stepford Wives” exploited liberated feminists’ fear of male chauvinists’ fear of liberated feminists, “Get Out” finds its tension in black people’s fear of white people’s fear of black people.


 Chris (Daniel Kaluuya, “Sicario”) is a black photographer who’s a little nervous about meeting the parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams, “Girls”), despite the fact that she’s enlightened enough to chew out a cop who asks for Chris’s ID after Rose hits a deer on their drive to her lakefront home. (After “The Invitation” and “A Cure for Wellness,” this makes the third thriller in the last year where a car hits a deer in the first ten minutes; it’s now officially a trend.)

Rose’s doctor parents Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford), and her med-student brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones, “X-Men: First Class”) are cordial enough, although they eventually unleash a torrent of microagressions: Dean can’t stop calling Chris “my man,” and Jeremy suggests that with some gym training, Chris’s “genetic makeup” would make him a “beast” in MMA.

Those familial faux pas aren’t the only thing making Chris uncomfortable: what’s up with the glacial stares from the family’s black staff members Georgina (Betty Gabriel, “Good Girls Revolt”) and Walter (Marcus Henderson, “Pete’s Dragon”)? Why the strange behavior from the elderly white guests at the house party? And who’s the guy (Lakeith Stanfield, “Short Term 12”) who looks so familiar to Chris, but is dressing and behaving so strangely? Generally, when a thriller is built on a “Something Strange Is Happening Here” plot, once the Something Strange is revealed, it’s time to wrap things up. It’s a testament to Peele’s storytelling skills that even after we know exactly what’s going on, we’re still engaged by the characters and by what else is going to happen. Editor Gregory Plotkin, best known for his work on the “Paranormal Activity” films, does standout work here, in both the micro — setting up specific jump-scare moments — and the macro — pacing the story, never letting the momentum drag, maintaining the tension even as we cut away from Chris to his best friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery, “The Carmichael Show”), who’s suspicious about this entire trip.

Peele never sledgehammers his ideas about race, but blackness and whiteness both drive the plot and provide a constant source of tension over the course of the film. It’s potent satire that’s very much about America in 2017; call it post-“post-racial.” And any thin-skinned white viewers who complain about how Caucasians are treated in the movie are invited to go read some Donald Bogle, write a book report, and get over it.

Two scenes involving the police put a somewhat fine point upon it, but Chris never really gets to relax; he’s in an affluent white world, and while no one’s ever outright hostile, he constantly feels on display and subject to judgment. (Even in a purportedly liberal household: Rose accurately predicts that Dean will mention how he wishes he could have voted for Obama a third time.) Peele delicately weaves in notions of white supremacy, eugenics and racial symbolism in ways that don’t call attention to themselves, but they’re there for those with eyes to see. Kaluuya makes a great everyman, expressing panic in small and subtle ways, but a movie like this always belongs to the people with shadowy motivations, so it’s Whitford and especially Keener, both playing with their screen image, who make the biggest impact. (Thanks to Keener and the film’s sound team, you’ll never hear a spoon scraping the side of a teacup the same way again.)

It’s a little on the nose to cast Landry Jones in a sinister role; he’s capable of being straightforward and charming in a film like John Boorman’s “Queen & Country,” but he’s also currently the go-to for directors who want a character with shifty eyes and a sweaty brow. Wiliams keeps the audience guessing, but the ultimate secret weapon of “Get Out” is the hilarious Howery, who walks off with every scene that’s not nailed down.

Once the Something Terrible is revealed, Peele and Plotkin and cinematographer Toby Oliver (“Wolf Creek 2”) don’t make the usual horror moves; they slow down instead of speeding up, using longer takes and brightly-lit rooms to make the grim reality even more frightening. The satirical tension gives way to an unbearable calm, and while there’s still humor, the last act remains breathlessly exciting and tense.

Jordan Peele has made an extraordinary leap in genre here, and he’s also crafted a horror film that has more blistering observations about race than half a dozen well-intentioned Oscar-bait dramas. “Get Out” is one of the very few films that’s ever going to be compared with both “You’re Next” and “13th,” and it heralds the arrival of a very promising new filmmaker.","Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves."
,," More pressingly creepy: this wealthy family’s pair of oddly out-of-time black servants (Marcus Henderson and a heartbreaking Betty Gabriel), both of whom beam as they work, regarding their white masters the way Will Smith’s Bagger Vance looked at that golfer schmo Matt Damon played.

In a comedy, these incidents might each prick a laugh and then pass, helped along by jaunty music and the genre’s dependence on redemptive narrative arcs — we’d be cued that these people still mean well. Here, each slight stings and lingers, Peele’s comic skills weaponized. Chris flinches, disappointed yet unsurprised, when a neighbor seizes his bicep and begins a sentence with “You know, with your genetic makeup…” The gag is simultaneously a send-up of white cluelessness, an evocation of the pain and humiliation of being viewed only as a body, and a clue in the twisty, satisfying mystery of what’s really going on in Rose’s suburb.

Something is going on, of course. Peele has counted the thrillers of Ira Levin (writer of Rosemary’s Baby and The Stepford Wives) among his inspirations, and most of Get Out finds Chris uncertain whether he’s the victim in a horror plot — or whether everyone just acts bizarre around him. Forever understanding, Rose hears Chris out when he says that he thinks that the help keep unplugging his phone, or that her mother hypnotized him the night before. She’ll make a flirty joke out of the ridiculousness of such a thought, but then volunteer to say something to her parents about it anyway — a move Chris must then shoot down, lest she make his situation worse. Chris’s only release: funny phone chats with his pal back in the city, a TSA agent played by the comedian Lil Rel Howery.

Get Out is searing satire, with scary/comic riffs on slavery and assimilation, but it’s also a smashing crowd-pleaser of a horror film, complete with mad science, cult-like crazies, and a creep-out homage to Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin. The buildup to the big revelations can be uneven, and one tearful monologue gets plopped into precisely the wrong spot, killing the momentum after the craziest scene. But Get Out is fully surprising in both concept and craft, with the scares never coming just when you expect them and the secrets more audacious than you might be guessing. At the raucous screening I attended, the mixed-race crowd cheered the bloody third act, the violence — like its victims — all stirringly well executed. But even as Peele brings the house down with both kinds of gag, we see the serious toll of all this horror on Chris’s face and body. Neither the movie nor anybody watching can take it all as a joke.Jordan Peele’s Get Out is the most trenchant studio release in years, a slow-building, often hilarious horror thriller built upon a dead-serious idea: that a black man walking alone through white suburbs is in as much danger as any slasher-flick teenager. Peele opens with that image, showing us, in a long and tense single take, a young man making his way down a sidewalk at night, studying the interchangeable homes for an address. A car eases up behind him, moving too slow, and the revelation — a sick joke you might choke on as you laugh — is that Get Out needs none of the phantasmagoric trappings of its genre to terrify. What’s the usual restless spirit or chainsaw maniac got on a paranoid white dude with a concealed carry?

Hollywood scare scenes — and the developers of suburbs — have long traded in the demonization of a figure that many white Americans, when speaking only to themselves, call the “big scary black guy.” For real, white folks, how often have you heard acquaintances or family members tell stories that turn on some version of that phrase? It’s sometimes whispered or accompanied by an apologetic wince, the goal of which is to goad the listener into nodding along or otherwise exhibiting wrongheaded empathy: So I’m walking back to my car and all of a sudden this — here the speaker glances around — big scary black guy comes up, but I just kept walking.

Peele has dared a radical inversion — and he’s enlisted all the power of popular genre filmmaking to do it. The first scene of Get Out casts the black man as the innocent victim, the car’s presumably white driver as the malevolent force, the suburban street as the space that force haunts. One minute in, this movie that will play every mall in America makes it viscerally clear that it’s not black guys who are scary — it’s neighborhoods packed with sheltered dopes who quake at the very thought of black guys.

The courageous writer-director is playing with fire, here, and I mean playing in the best sense of the word. He’s half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, who in their sketches have always glanced lightly against hard truths. Horror and comedy both turn on gags, and Peele demonstrates a fluid facility with both kinds, which often in Get Out aren’t distinct from each other at all. The story finds Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black photographer, venturing into that same suburb from the opening, this time to meet the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams). What he encounters, at first, could be a straight-faced sketch about well-heeled but sheltered white liberals: Rose’s neurosurgeon father (Bradley Whitford) can’t resist telling Chris that he would have voted for Obama a third time; her lacrosse-bro brother (Caleb Landry Jones) observes that, with his build and some serious training, Chris would be a “beast” of an MMA fighter; her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) makes things more awkward every time she tries to make them less so.

","This movie has the worst plot I've ever seen in a horror movie. It's right there with all the Jeepers Creepers movies. The fact that white people want to use black people for their own personal happiness is what really gets me. This is seriously the highlight of the movie. Somehow all white people want to use black people for their bodies. Another form of slavery with a terrible horrible film twist. Not only is this premise terrible overall, its very unbelievable. A skinny tall flat chested/ no butt white woman seduces black men and takes them home to become her parents experiments. And somehow no one goes out to look for their black family members. No one cares. People just go missing after dating a white chick and no one cares. Oh yeah at the end of this movie, the black guy someone how survives and his friend comes to his rescue in a cop car. His friend wasn't even a police officer, he worked in an airport. This movie is a complete WASTE OF TIME! It sucks"
,,"A jolt-a-minute horroshow laced with racial tension and stinging satirical wit. How is one movie all that? See Get Out, from debuting director Jordan Peele (one half of the comic team of Key and Peele), and get woke. This socially aware scary movie takes you by surprise, setting the scene for a slasher flick that’s a ticking timebomb. And then, ka-boom.

“Have you told your parents I’m black?” Those are practically the first words that aspiring photographer Chris Washington (Sicario‘s Daniel Kaluuya) speaks to his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams), just before they drive off to white surburbia 2.0 for a weekend meet and greet with her parents, the epitome of white privilege. Rose’s dad, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), is a neurosurgeon, a perfect compliment to her hypnotherapist mom, Missy (Catherine Keener), who can’t wait to get to the roots of Chris’ traumatic past as an orphan. The Armitage welcome seems genuinely warm. But fasten your seatbelts. Dean, a self-congratulating liberal (“I would have voted for Obama for a third term”), winks when he asks how long their “thang” has been going on. He also pointedly shows off a photo of his own father running alongside black gold-medalist Jesse Owens in the 1936 Olympics. He’s got well-meaning liberal bona fides, in other words.  Chris is quick to pick up a sketchy vibe, especially from the black staff who suggest slavery is still thriving in concept and execution in the upper-crust ‘burbs. The handyman, Walter (Marcus Henderson), gives Chris the once-over way more than once; the housekeeper, Georgina (Betty Gabriel), has a lobotomized smile right out of The Stepford Wives. Add Caleb Landry Jones as Rose’s nutjob older brother and a party scene where a black guest (Atlanta‘s Lakeith Stanfield) dresses like he’s posing for an aggressively white Town & Country photo spread, and we’re off to Creepytown. “Get out” is the advice phoned in by Chris’ TSA officer friend Rod (a hilarious LilRel Howery), who suspects some weird, brainwashing, sex-slave shit going on.

He isn’t that far off. Not to give anything away, but you should know that the mixed-race Peele is having the time of his life juggling horror and laughs to skewer of the hypocrisies of race in America. For a first-time director, working from his own script, Peele comes up aces, bringing all the elements of filmmaking together to raise tension and awareness. And his work with actors is exemplary, from the veterans (you expect the best from Keener and Whitford – and you get it) to the newcomers; Kaluuya is a star in the making, and Williams takes a riff on the character she played on Girls to places Lena Dunham never investigated. She’s dynamite.

If Peele goes more for the jugular than the subtext in the final scenes, it doesn’t distract from the provocative blend of scares and smarts he uses to stick it to the white liberal elite. “I wanted to make something I hadn’t seen before,” he’s been quoted as saying when asked why he wanted to make this particular movie. Mission accomplished.","Can't think of a good reason to recommend this.

A black guy visited his white girlfriend's family estate only to discover the family's dark secret. What would happen? Could he survive? That premise drew me to this movie.

The movie seemed suspenseful, but concluded poorly. As the dark secret unfolded, I noticed some similarities in concept between a movie released over 10 years ago and this one. After I finished watching this one, I realized that a movie released over 10 years ago could wipe the floor with this one. That movie released 10 years ago is called The Skeleton Key.

The Skeleton Key has a perfectly dark ending, whereas this movie has a happy and funny one. Happy ending? OK. But being hilarious is a big Nono. It completely ruined the horror built up during the first 1 hour of the movie! What is the point of having the black police officer coming to Chris' rescue? What is the point of having this funny character in the first place? The movie would have been 10 times better without him!

Instead, the ending the audience got was rushed and underwhelming. The black police officer out of nowhere appeared and rescued Chris. When asked how he had found Chris, he simply said he had relied on transportation network to track Chris. Situation handled! Really? How funny.

Perhaps the filmmaker ran out of ideas and didn't even know how to conclude the movie. Personally, I would have loved to see a dark ending. The white police officer who appeared earlier in the movie would arrive and arrest Chris. Rosy lying on the ground with gunshot wound in her belly would scream for help, framing Chris for murder. After all, Chris touched the gun and his fingerprints were on it. The movie wished to express the oppression of black people in a white society, right? Chris getting locked up and prosecuted would suit the theme perfectly. Nobody would believe his story. The ending would be even better if Rosy was rescued and set free, continuing to ensnare black people for her cult white secret society's harvest and sacrifice. Wouldn't that have been darker, more logical and exciting?

The current ending is awful. It completely ruins the story. This movie is awarded 1 star for decent acting. Recognized the lead from Black Mirror. He's really good."
Lady Bird,Oscar,"Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s semiautobiographical Lady Bird is both generous and joyous, but when it stings, it stings deep. At one point, Saoirse Ronan, as disgruntled high school senior Christine, begs her mother, Laurie Metcalf’s Marion, for a magazine at the supermarket: “It’s only $3! I’m having a bad week!” Marion brushes her off, and it could be the usual mom move of just saying no–until she reaches the cash register and you realize that this respectable-looking suburban woman can barely cover the family groceries.

There’s no lingering, sentimental camera work, no telltale bummer music. Metcalf’s face betrays nothing so obvious as frustration or anxiety. Instead, it’s as if every molecule of her body has been, out of necessity, trained to count money. Meanwhile, when you’re a teenage girl wanting a magazine–so you can look at makeup ads, or pictures of rock stars, or fashion spreads featuring clothes you can’t afford but want to ogle anyway–it is among the world’s most straightforward, achievable desires. This measly dream costs $3, and Christine’s mother won’t–can’t–let her have it.

There are tons of movies about coming of age in the suburbs, but few are as astute as Lady Bird when it comes to class. Even so, the movie–set in Sacramento circa 2002–is more universal than it is insular. Gerwig knows, as her young heroine doesn’t yet, that what really defines you as an emerging grownup is how you handle everything else clustered around issues of money. The first love who’s all sorts of wrong yet also perfectly right, the desire to hang with the cool crowd only to realize that your longtime, uncool friends are a thousand times better and, perhaps most complicated of all, the slow crawl toward a truce with the parent who drives you crazy. Gerwig has a sense of humor about even fairly painful subjects. She doesn’t make filmmaking, or filmgoing for that matter, seem like drudgery. Ronan’s Christine–the movie’s title comes from the new name she’s given herself, a misguided teenage attempt at reinvention–attends a Catholic school she can barely tolerate, though this isn’t one of those joints filled with awful nuns. The great Lois Smith appears as Sister Sarah Joan, aged but groovy, who looks at the awkward raspberry tint of Christine’s hair and the half-affected scowl beneath it and sees nothing but promise. Christine finds that very nice first boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and a less-than-satisfactory second one (Timothée Chalamet). But mostly she fights with her mother, and if words were bayonets, blood would flow. Meanwhile, Christine’s beloved, depression-prone dad (Tracy Letts) looks on helplessly, though he does become her partner in crime in pulling off her one big goal.

Lady Bird‘s performances are all lovely, which you could chalk up to smart casting. But maybe it’s also that Gerwig–who previously co-directed, with Joe Swanberg, the 2008 Nights and Weekends–is kind of like the cartoon Sleeping Beauty, good at breezily orchestrating the special gifts of each bird in the forest. She’s certainly attuned to Ronan, who resembles a Leonardo da Vinci Madonna, if you were to add a few angry teenage thunderbolts and a scattering of mild acne. Beneath all that free-radical exasperation, Christine’s face is radiant, open, alive. It’s only when she gets everything she ever wanted that she’s hit by the weight of all she’s left behind. That’s usually how it works around age 18. Lady Bird puts you right back there, no matter how many years have elapsed. ","I wish I could agree with the high-scoring reviews, but I cannot. This movie seemed flat, monotone, mildly entertaining. The lead was perfunctory...another disgruntled teen who desperately wants to get out of her home town and fly to the East Coast ""where there is culture"". New Hampshire and culture? Hmmm... Lady Bird clashes with her mom (Laurie Metcalf...who deserves 10 stars by herself). So, a teen clashes with her mom...wow...news flash. Dad loses his job...and seems to be just fine with that, even though they are running out of money. Weird. The supporting cast seems to be chosen to complete a requisite menu of characters: the overweight but beautiful-inside best friend, the gorgeous and wealthy but shallow new friend, the handsome but...surprise...gay boy. Somehow this lack of originality does not drive a strong story line. The crash and burn ending is, well, the only twist in this story...so, back home she goes, and realizes she really does love Sacramento. Perhaps Sacramento is a metaphor for almost every town in America, but the story never hints at that. So, sorry, this one just did not resonate with me."
,,"Lady Bird – which played this week at the New York Film Festival – is the solo directorial debut for Greta Gerwig (she co-directed 2008’s Night’s and Weekends) and it’s an utter delight. It’s getting tougher and tougher to grasp onto anything these days that that could be described as “delightful,” so please don’t take this for granted. You should see Lady Bird (it will be in theaters November 3) and, when you do, savor its delightfulness because this is a tougher and tougher commodity to find.

Last week I saw Springsteen on Broadway here in New York, and there’s a part of the show in which Bruce Springsteen laments his love/hate relationship with his hometown of Freehold, New Jersey. These mixed feelings are embedded in many of us when it comes to where we are all originally from. (I certainly feel that way about Missouri. We moved around so much when I was a kid, it’s hard for me to pick one true hometown, but for some reason they were all in Missouri.) I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately, especially with how divided everyone has become and how “home” for me has less and less meaning because, when I do go back, I barely recognize it anymore. With these thoughts already circling in my head, I saw Lady Bird, which is Greta Gerwig’s hate/love letter to her hometown of Sacramento, California (dubbed “the Midwest of California” in the movie). I can’t remember the last time a film covered this topic so well.

Here’s what makes Lady Bird unique and special: In movies that deal with “hometowns,” many filmmakers will have the protagonist of the story have to go back home; often because there’s either a death in the family, or someone is sick, or the protagonist crashed and burned in “the big city” and doesn’t have anywhere else to go. What Gerwig does is smart: instead of going back, she sets the film in 2003 and explores what it was that created these emotions in the first place.

After I saw Lady Bird, a publicist for the film asked me what I thought and I just kind of blurted out something about Superbad and the publicist started to frown. Superbad is a great movie, but it’s probably not the movie they want to be compared to while launching an Oscar campaign. (Changing my statement to “a highbrow Superbad” didn’t help.) But my point was that it reminded me of how Seth Rogen and Even Goldberg wrote about their experiences in high school, then cast Jonah Hill and Michael Cera to play versions of themselves. Gerwig does the same with Saoirse Ronan who is both fantastic as Lady Bird and, at times, I had to remind myself I wasn’t actually watching Greta Gerwig, circa 2003. (Also, perhaps my Superbad comparison was exacerbated by the fact that Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill’s sister, plays Lady Bird’s best friend. If any Lady Bird publicists are reading this, I promise I’ll stop with this comparison now.)

Ronan plays Christine McPherson, but prefers to be called Lady Bird. She attends a Catholic high school and, more than anything, wants to go to college as far away from Sacramento as possible. Her parents (played by Tracy Letts and Laurie Metcalf) are struggling financially, but her dad is supportive of her plans to go to school on the East Coast, but her mother (Metcalf is dynamite in this role) is vehemently against this idea and it adds tension to an already strained relationship between Lady Bird and her mother.

Lady Bird begins to distance herself from her friends to seek out people who, on the surface, may seem more interesting before realizing that may not have been the best of ideas. (Think back to high school, the “coolest” people were often, in reality, the most boring. It takes awhile to realize this.) But the almost-catharsis that Lady Bird goes through as it seems more and more likely she’ll be living in New York City (spoiler alert: Greta Gerwig hasn’t lived her whole life in Sacramento) is quite touching. Her friends and her family and her town mean a whole lot more now that she knows she won’t be around them much longer.

For those of us who moved away, and stayed away, Lady Bird will have a lot of meaning. Bruce Springsteen is right, we do have a complicated relationship with where we are from. But as Springsteen says during his Broadway show, he’s the guy known for singing about hitting the road, getting out of town and never coming back. Then Springsteen delivers the punchline, “I currently live 10 miles from the house where I grew up.” Lady Bird made me feel something I hadn’t felt in a long time: It made me miss home.","Lady Bird is the directorial debut of Greta Gerwig revolving around a seventeen-year-old girl played by Saoirse Ronan coming of age in Sacramento and without a doubt it instantly takes the spot as one of the greatest directorial debuts of all time.

I wouldn't exactly call the premise of Lady Bird original due to clichéd coming of age movies being made almost every year but the story and dialogue are realistic enough and with masterful directing and all across the board fantastic performances Lady Bird easily makes up for it. Also, Lady Bird is mature enough to learn from and it doesn't use annoying and cheesy clichés which makes its plot least seem original. Aside from the acting and directing the presentation of this film is beautiful as it explores a few cities and a lot of well-shot locations thanks to the wonderful and underrated cinematography by Sam Levy. The best part of Lady Bird is its social commentary which is very relevant to the 2002 setting.

Overall Lady Bird is a great coming of age movie filled with well-written characters and great performances. I would recommend it to anyone except to the people that get easily bored with Oscar-bait dramas.
"
,,"Lady Bird opens on a road-tripping mother and daughter, retreating from a dismal college tour, crossing the flat central valley of California for home and Sacramento, listening to the final passages of The Grapes of Wrath.

Writer-director Greta Gerwig is winking at us, encoding a couple of ironies in this reference. Steinbeck's story followed migrants toward the supposed Eden of California, but the title character here is a high school teen (Saoirse Ronan) who grew up there and wants to leave the worst way, almost literally — she jumps out of the car during an argument with her mother (Laurie Metcalf). And that's the other irony — Steinbeck's closing gesture of maternal warmth contrasts with the fraught mother-daughter relationship in this scene, one that intensifies as we go, adding shape to the story and leading to its memorable conclusion. The movie is a coming-of-age tale, but it's also a story of loving, warring mother and daughter at the point of separation, presented by Gerwig with great affection and skill, to hilarious, and moving effect.

What's behind the mother's tough love? She says she wants her daughter to be ""the best version of herself."" Daughter, though, spits out versions like a faulty copier, none of which the mother can stand. The young woman feels she has outgrown everything. Not just Sacramento — Catholic school, virginity, her hair color, her best friend, even the name her mother gave her. She calls herself Lady Bird. When she runs for student council, she makes posters with a bird head on her body, or her head on a bird body.

She loses.


Lady Bird has more nerve than tact (you've seen glimpses of this persona in Gerwig's Frances Ha and Mistress America), and as the director underlines the character's eccentricities, there are a few fearful moments when you think the movie will be a collection of affectations.

But the characters are too real, Gerwig's eye for the adolescent lives of young women too keen — notice the way Lady Bird edits (and at times diminishes) herself in order to appeal to boys.

She falls for the too-good-to-be-true lead (Lucas Hedges) in the school play, then a dime-store anarchist (Timothée Chalamet) who makes a great display of hating Dave Matthews and the prom, a posture Lady Bird bends to accommodate.

Lady Bird's real high school soul mate is her best friend (Beanie Feldstein), another relationship that is sorely tested. Lady Bird is prone to serious mistakes, the way teenagers are, but as events unfold we see that someone has instilled in her a fundamental decency — candidates include her quietly observant father (Tracy Letts), a mentoring Catholic School nun (Lois Smith), and, of course, mom.

Lady Bird is becoming the best version of herself.  Yet the mother-daughter breach remains — their default setting is family feud, neither can change the ritualized trajectory of their arguments, and Lady Bird flies off without a hug.

And yet we know that she's taken her mother — and her family and her teachers and Sacramento — with her. How?

Gerwig ends her movie with a feat of structural daring — making us understand and feel a reconciliation between characters who are not on screen together.

No director would let a writer get away with that.

Unless the director were the writer, and as talented, innovative, and generous as Gerwig.","I watched the trailer and saw that it received 100% on rottentomatoes.com so I figured it must be worth watching, but when I walked out of the theater I felt disgruntled and wanted my money and time back. The movie reminded me of 'Garden State' (2004) in that it was trying to be quirky, deep, and epic all at the same time, but was just another forgettable film. It really fell flat for me and the script/dialog was sometimes awkward and/or did not make sense. I'm surprised IMDb only listed one 'goof'. There were a couple of funny moments and the soundtrack wasn't bad -- those are the only nice things I can say about it."
,,"Back in early September, the fall film season looked to be in rough shape. Nearly everything coming out of the major film festivals – which typically dictates how you'll spend your spare autumnal weekends – arrived with a dent. Downsizing left Venice strong, but landed in Telluride and Toronto with expectations that echoed its title. The Shape of Water had some viewers feeling as cold as the blood that runs through its featured creature. Suburbicon was dead-on-arrival. Molly's Game tripped on a heartbreaking third-act plot branch. No one can make their mind up about Mother!, and that's probably for the best.

So when buzz trickled out of Telluride for Lady Bird, the (sorta) directorial debut of Greta Gerwig, I tried to remain skeptical. No doubt Gerwig has been on a remarkable roll, ostensibly since she creatively partnered with filmmaker Noah Baumbach but really since she leapt onto the screen with performances in Hannah Takes the Stairs, Baghead and Nights and Weekends (the latter of which she co-directed with Joe Swanberg, hence the ""sorta""). Those ultra-low-budget films belonged to the ""mumblecore"" movement of late-aught American indie cinema, though it's a term Gerwig hates, and rightly so: It implies a somehow lesser-than status, a patronizing, ""Oh look, you cool kids made a movie for nothing, how cute.""

This ""good for you, hipster cutie"" reputation has been unfairly following Gerwig around her entire career, allowing critics to shift the credit for her essential contributions to the scripts of Frances Ha and Mistress America toward Baumbach. It's much easier, apparently, to label Gerwig a mere muse and Baumbach her art-house Henry Higgins, him sculpting elite-cinema brilliance from her scrappy li'l efforts.

Still, no matter how stellar Gerwig's work has been as both a writer and performer (why are we all not collectively obsessed with last year's 20th Century Women?), the Lady Bird campaign felt overblown. A coming-of-age story based on Gerwig's own teenage years in Sacramento? Sounds fine, even great, but surely not one of the best films of the year.

Check that. After settling into a TIFF screening two months ago – when the excitement for the film was so high that fest organizers booked an Imax screen to accomodate the critics and industry players – Lady Bird knocked me down, blew me away, destroyed and then built me right back up again. It is that rarest of pleasures in the movie world: a film worth the hype.

Lady Bird's bona fides are clear two minutes in. Gerwig opens on what seems like a seen-it-all-before scene: The teenage Christine, who prefers to go by Lady Bird, is driving with mother Marion as they scope out colleges. They've just finished listening to a book on tape while cruising down a dry stretch of Californian road, when an argument erupts. As mother and daughter respectively, Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan nail every expected beat. The words are heated. The glances are cold. And then, when you think Gerwig will cut to a scene of domestic complacency, Christine throws herself out of the moving car. Roll opening credits – and welcome to the smartest, sincerest, most acidically funny family drama in ages.

For 93 tight minutes, Gerwig lets her story – in all senses of the word, given the script's autobiographical nature – skip vignette-like across the course of Christine's final stint in high school. There are academic pressures, disappointing boyfriends (who happen to be played by current indie-cinema MVPs Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet), a best-friend rift, mean girls, kind teachers, go-nowhere part-time jobs, college applications, drinking games, late-night pizza, concocted drama. The usual obstacles and detritus of a lower-middle-class suburban teenage life, handled with care and genuine compassion by a director who's lived it.

Looming above, or perhaps lurking below, everything is Christine's relationship with her mother. The two hate each other, they love each other, they want to escape from one another so badly but they can't truly bear the thought of separating. It's exhausting and heartbreaking, and never less than captivating. Part of this is due to Gerwig's sharp script and nimble direction – her scenes seem so perfectly cut and staged that it's almost supernatural – but mostly from the performances she wrings from Ronan and Metcalf. Instantly relatable, and wholly real, the pair deliver fearless turns that likely represent the peak of their powers. (Hopefully not, but it's hard to imagine another director giving them such generous material as Gerwig.) Tracy Letts goes toe-to-toe with the pair as Christine's kindhearted father, but this is a mother-daughter show, and one for the ages.

The fact that Lady Bird is Gerwig's (sorta) first time in the director's chair is beside the point. Yes, for a debut, it's astounding how much command she has over style, tone, performance, mood. But this film would be recognized as an all-time achievement whether it was someone's first, third or 31st film. There is no rookie-film handicap required in grading the excellence on display. There are no fireworks or twists or unnecessary frills here, nor should there be – this is simply perfect filmmaking from a voice that demands to be heard.

The fall movie season is saved. Thank you, Greta Gerwig.","A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed.

""Lady Bird"" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism.

That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqué, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one.

Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.

The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the ""serious"" scenes)."
,,"""Lady Bird,"" like most terrific films, is the product of a singular vision.

That vision belongs to Greta Gerwig, the supremely talented, often quirky actor, who wrote and directed the movie and happily brought those sensibilities to it. But it's not just an art-house exercise; this is a fully realized film, with a confident eye and lived-in performances.

What a treat.

Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine McPherson, who wants everyone to call her ""Lady Bird."" Her given name? Sure, she says. ""It's given to me by me."" This gives you a little insight into the character. So does her reaction to an argument with her mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf, fantastic) — she jumps out of a moving car.  Lady Bird is a student at a Catholic school in Sacramento during 2002 who longs to get out and go to college back east where she can become a writer. (Gerwig also grew up in Sacramento, went to a Catholic school and moved east for college, but she says the movie isn't really autobiographical.)

As with many teenagers, as far as Lady Bird is concerned all of life's miseries are visited upon her. And sometimes she's right. Her mom, a psychiatric nurse, constantly works double shifts to help pay the bills. Her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), struggles to find work, though he serves as a kind of behind-the-scenes ally for her. The trouble with private college, of course, is the expense. Plus, Lady Bird's grades aren't what they might be — not bad, not great. Then there are boys, of course. She starts a romance with Danny (Lucas Hedges) that goes south in a surprising way. She takes up with Kyle (Timothée Chalamet), a pretentious twit disguised as ... a pretentious twit. Of course he's in a band.

She considers trading in her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) for the more-popular Jenna (Odeya Rush), the kind of girl who casually notes, of a wealthy neighborhood, ""Oh, that's where we had our starter home."" Lady Bird, meanwhile, lives on the literal wrong side of the tracks, a joke in which her mother finds no humor. (She doesn't find humor in much.) ll of which is a long way of saying: Lady Bird is a teenager. 

What makes the film so special, and so much more satisfying than the usual coming-of-age story, is the respect with which Gerwig (who doesn't act in the film) treats that experience, and how fully realized Ronan's portrayal of it is. Sure, as is often the case with teenage characters in movies, Lady Bird is a little more clever than most. But sometimes she's also a dope, as maddening this minute as she was charming the last. Ronan navigates that tricky landscape with seeming ease, completely at home in the character, drawing us in.

Everyone's good here. Even the smaller characters never come off as one-dimensional or clichéd. Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), who runs Lady Bird's school, could have been the typical rule-and-ruler-wielding nun, but she's a good sport, and in some respects has greater insight into Lady Bird's life than Lady Bird herself. All of them are part of Lady Bird's life, with all the good and bad they bring to it. She's a kid, really, learning how not to be, or how to be something more. It's messy and funny and sad and sweet, Lady Bird's life, and Gerwig's movie. As with ""The Big Sick"" earlier this year, you're so instantly drawn to the characters and the film that you hate for it to end. But that feeling comes later, since as it's playing you're too entranced to think of anything else.

It's a great movie.","How refreshing and invigorating to meet new people. Familiar and new all at the same time. Familiar because the extraordinary Saorise Ronan connected me to her soul, as soon as she appeared on the screen. Remarkable. She is, without question, one of the best actresses of her generation. She has exceptional support here, Laurie Metcalf as the mother determined to keep her feelings at bay, Lucas Hedges, providing one of the most moving, truthful moments in the film and allowing Saorise Ronan to give us a masterful class in empathy. Timothee Chalamet proves in a very short space of time that he is here to stay. His Elio in Call Me By your Name will be considered one of the great breakthrough performances in film history. Tracy Letts plays the father with irresistible humanity and then, of course, a heartfelt congratulations to the writer, director Greta Gerwing -"
,,"Greta Gerwig has previously collaborated with other filmmakers, both in writing and direction, but “Lady Bird” is the first movie in which she’s been completely in charge — and she is better off on her own. This is warm and intuitive work, striking that elusive balance between inspiration and control.

Most recently, Gerwig co-wrote two screenplays with director Noah Baumbach (“Frances Ha” and “Mistress America”), and the sense that came from those films was of visions in collision: Baumbach’s pinched, insulated vision versus Gerwig’s generous, expansive vision. “Lady Bird” shows that that diagnosis may have been correct. Gerwig has made a good-hearted film, a kind film, and not kind in an empty-headed, generalized sort of way, but in a way that’s alert and intelligent about people’s feelings.

Gerwig’s warmth as an artist becomes important, because in “Lady Bird” she is dealing in what is often the most self-centered of forms, the coming-of-age story; particularly, the coming-of-age story based on the filmmaker’s own life. True, Gerwig has gone out of her way to say that “Lady Bird” is not factually autobiographical, but she admits that to some extent it’s emotionally autobiographical. And like the central character, Geriwg grew up in Sacramento and graduated high school early in the millennium.

In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, “Lady Bird” would be a movie all about the trials and tribulations leading up to the magnificent creation of “Me,” as in “Moi,” as in the glorious, wonderful person who made the movie. But Gerwig is not so self-centered. She is interested in Sacramento and how much she loves it. She is interested in Lady Bird’s mother and father (Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts, respectively). She also has the courage and discipline to follow her interests and her intuitions down some blind alleys that lead her toward making something that’s not like other people’s movies. It’s better.

Saoirse Ronan plays the title character at a fever pitch, earnest and aggressive, as if every moment were a matter of life and death. This means she often gets to be funny, but funny in passing. Ronan never plays for the laugh.

As the movie begins, Lady Bird — real name, Christine — is a high school senior who dreams of going to school on the East Coast, preferably New York, though her family is broke and would prefer she go to UC Davis.

The movie traces all the familiar rites of teenage passage, without ever once feeling programmatic. Gerwig cares about all her characters, so that even the most minor isn’t a means to an end. Incidents are arranged with artistry, so that we are always engaged and always care about what will happen next. But the movie cultivates an illusion of randomness, a sense of life unfolding at a regular pace, a pace too regular for its aggressive protagonist. This is turning into quite a month, with the emergence of two young female writer/directors — Margaret Betts (“Novitiate”) is the other — who might very well do great work for decades. In the case of Gerwig, what’s particularly striking is her ability to find the unexpected, illuminating detail and her simultaneous sense of taste of proportion. So she can make her point, but then she also knows when to stop making it.

One example will have to suffice, but it captures the spirit of film and the nature of Gerwig’s talent: After having sex for the first time, Lady Bird comes down the stairs in her boyfriend’s house and sees the boyfriend’s father, asleep in a chair. The man is dying, and he’s not that old. He’s thin and looks awful. The shot is five seconds, maybe less. Gerwig doesn’t cut to some big, feeling-filled close-up of Lady Bird, because Gerwig has the human decency to know that this moment is not about Lady Bird but about this poor guy. It’s just a sight, a vision, and it’s gone.

But what does that scene do? It colors everything that we’ve just witnessed in the scene before. It explains much of what we already know about the boyfriend. It also reminds us of the kinds of brief moments we sometimes witness in our own lives, particularly when we’re very young, that we never forget. This is a poetic use of cinema, all the better in that it doesn’t announce itself as poetry.

Such is Gerwig’s compassion as a filmmaker, and it allows her to open up “Lady Bird” as she goes along. A movie about the splendidness of a rebellious teenager becomes a movie about what it’s like for her mother, and what she’s going through, too, and what she’s worried about, and what her marriage has been like. This is simply beautiful work.

And to think, all this — a world, a life — in just 93 minutes.","Greta Gerwig, usually disappoints me - as an actress and now in her writing and directorial debut, LADY BIRD, a coming-of-age film about a seventeen-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento ""the Midwest of California"" (the best line in the film,) and the love/hate relationship she has with her working-class family and peers. Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of ""ironic class strivers."" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.

Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson - a nickname she gives herself to appear distinctive. I am sympathetic to the aspirations of a young, self- involved teenager searching for a path to glamour and excitement. Youth is an innocent time - one open to endless fantasies - reality has not yet penetrated the hermetic world of dreams. The ""firsts"" of the teen years - first kiss, first sexual experience leading to the loss of virginity, first self-awareness of one's own ethical and moral values, and the critical realization that the world is not always spinning for you alone - solely for your personal gratification.

The film opens with Lady Bird and her mother - a wonderful performance by Laurie Metcalf - who is driving and listening to Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath on audio tape - both simultaneously weeping, moved by the beauty of the spoken words; their mirrored responses reflect their enduring affection. And suddenly the mood is shattered and we see the other side of their relationship - a mother who works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse to supplement the family income so that her daughter can go to a private Catholic school; the burden of monetary expenses weighs heavily on her shoulders. The ever-present resentment that comes with sacrifice is often unleashed on her oblivious daughter in a torrent of sarcasm, humiliation, and disparagement.

Greta Gerwig is at her best in the scenes between mother/father and daughter. A lovely tenderness exists which is often choked and stifled by the exigencies of financial straits.The underpinnings are there for a truly fine movie, but in the rush to cast a wide net, Gerwig compromises her subjects' humanity, placing a veil of bromides over what could have been profound interactions. Maybe next time. I hope so."
,,"In the luminous coming-of-age film “Brooklyn” two years ago, I wondered if we’d seen Saoirse Ronan taking her final step away from teenage roles. Thank goodness writer/director Greta Gerwig (better known as an actor, in “Maggie’s Plan” and “Frances Ha” among others) talked her into doing one more. “Lady Bird” is a joy, from its start (a teenager and her mother, sleeping face to face on a hotel bed on a college trip) to its finish, when that ever-so-slightly older young woman takes a breath and looks out — hopefully, nervously, excitedly — into a limitless future.

Lady Bird (Ronan) is really named Christine, but she’s taken on the quirky moniker because she wants to be special; she yearns, in her teenage way, to be something, though it doesn’t much matter what. “Lady Bird” unfolds over a year in the early aughts in Sacramento, California, following Lady Bird’s senior year at a Catholic high school to her early college days. Along the way, it traces Lady Bird’s complex relationship with her mother (Laurie Metcalf), a nurse who works overtime to keep the family going after her husband (Tracy Letts) loses his job, and her tentative explorations of love, with two very different classmates (Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet).

As an actor, Gerwig has shown an enchantingly light touch; she brings that to her work as director, as “Lady Bird” skims along happily, showing us moments both crucial and trivial in a teenage girl’s life. (There are moments here as funny as any comedy this year, particularly a scene in which the school’s football coach gets drafted into directing the senior-class play.) But there’s depth everywhere, in the note-perfect supporting performances (led by the great Metcalf, who practically vibrates with equal measures of endless love and profound irritation), in the gentle sense of place, and in the film’s palpable affection for its characters, who are often given the time and space to just hang with each other. The film’s depiction of the quiet comfort of being with your best friend, for example, is unexpectedly moving. And at the center of it all is Ronan, whose face, as always, provides its own movie screen. She plays the flinty Lady Bird/Christine as both a blank slate and a sketched-in canvas — you can see the colors and nuances, filling themselves in, as she grows up before our eyes. At a meeting with her school’s college counselor, Lady Bird — whose grades are not stellar — says that she wants to leave California and go somewhere “like Yale, but not Yale because I probably couldn’t get in.” The world for her is a book she’s desperate to open; the pleasure of “Lady Bird” is watching those pages begin to turn.","I mean it has some good acting, but the story is trite, and seriously uninspired. There is nothing to see here that hasn't been done in about one million other Hollywood films exactly like this one. Its the typical Hollywood depiction of the 50's, complete with some conservative strawmen to bat around. Its got your typical ""brilliant forward thinking woman who doens't need any men"" sort of thing. I can't recall what was up with the father in the story, because I just don't remember him or why he wasn't there...or really anything else. I kept on falling asleep."
,,"Self-assured, fastidious, unusual, written with sass and directed with sensitivity and style, Lady Bird is a year-end surprise that lands in 2017’s pile of mediocrity like a stray emerald in a pile of discarded rhinestones. The writer-director is the critically acclaimed actress Greta Gerwig. Riding in on waves of advance attention on the film-festival circuit, Lady Bird, her feature debut in both guises, deserves applause. It hit me unexpectedly—like a snowball between the eyes. Everything about Lady Bird is different, including the setting. What was the last film you saw that takes place in Sacramento?  Taking a fresh look at the awkward, frustrating transition from lonely adolescence to terrifying womanhood, Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical tour de force about growing up in California’s capital captivates from start to finish. The always splendid Saoirse Ronan looks as dismal as humanly possible as miserable 17-year-old Christine (“Lady Bird”) McPherson, a high school student on the verge of graduation who dreams of any change in life that comes her way, as long as it gets her out of her dead-end life in the suburbs. With bad skin and ugly raspberry streaked hair that always looks like it desperately needs shampoo, Lady Bird enters her senior year experiencing sensations new and familiar, with starling serendipity. She starts dating Danny (the enchanting Lucas Hedges, who crashed through the unknown barrier to stardom last year in Manchester by the Sea) and thinks she’s found true love until she discovers him in a closet, passionately kissing another guy. Later she loses her virginity to Kyle, the cutest boy in school.

She adopts new friendships and outgrows others. After attending a school so progressive that, for a senior class musical, the drama club stages a production of  Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along, she agonizes over how to get a scholarship to an Eastern university her parents can’t afford instead of the California state college they urge her to settle for. She fights with her adopted brother, worries about her alcoholic, manic-depressive father (playwright Tracey Letts of August: Osage County, doing an impressive acting turn), and declares war on her chain-smoking, hard-nosed, penny-pinching mother (a fabulous, scene-stealing Laurie Metcalf, who plays every charged emotion with a three-dimensional passion that I predict will easily get her an Oscar nomination). Even when it implodes, the dialogue sparkles. (“Are you two getting a divorce over this?” “No,” says her meek, exasperating father. “We can’t afford to.”) With her overwhelming refusal to accept second best, her eventual scholarship, and her parents re-financing their house, Lady Bird does finally get to New York in the end, and every emotional hurt, real or imagined, is discarded in favor of divided emotions that symbolize maturity. Reading a cache of letters her mother never mailed that her father packed with her belongings, Lady Bird realizes at last that the years of harsh criticism and biting sarcasm she endured were only superficial masks to cover up the love her mom couldn’t express. The emotional impact as she faces the future, in a brave new world, resonates with the viewer in a surge of joy.

In addition to her other obvious strengths, Gerwig expresses a real talent for perfect casting, and directs every actor with the kind of generosity that eschews clichés—especially Saoirse Ronan. In the end, even her acne clears up—not as a makeup-department triumph, but as a natural part of the aging process. You’ll find no wasted scenes devised to pad the length, no overwrought monologues that distract from the film’s brisk tempo, no exchange of words that ring false. Lady Bird is that rare movie in which everything astonishes and leaves you charmed, breathless, and anxious for more.","Although this movie was only about an hour and a half it felt like over two hours. I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end. The acting was good, but the plot felt like the writer took everything that could affect a teenager and threw it into a movie. I generally like thought evoking movies, but this one was just not compelling.

Of the three people I went with, only one would recommend it and then only to a limited viewing audience. A lot of people really liked this movie, at least in the reviews, but there no one in the audience was saying how much they loved the movie as they exited the theater."
,,"In a Q&A following a festival screening of her masterful solo directorial debut Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig quoted Weil, and it’s clear from the film that this spirit of faith, love, generosity, and attention animates the whole endeavor. Lady Bird is a coming-of-age film starring the great Saoirse Ronan as Christine — or “Lady Bird,” as she’s re-christened herself — and it’s as funny, smart, and filled with yearning as its heroine. Lady Bird is an act of attention, and thus love, from Gerwig, not just toward her hometown of Sacramento but also toward girlhood, and toward the feeling of always being on the outside of wherever real life is happening. The movie also confirms what movie lovers have long suspected: Gerwig is by far one of the most talented filmmakers working today, both onscreen and behind the camera, confident and winsome in a way nearly unparalleled by her contemporaries. Lady Bird is the rare movie that manages to be affectionate, entertaining, hilarious, witty, and confident; it’s one of the best films of 2017, and certainly my favorite. Lady Bird opens with an epigraph, something Joan Didion told Michiko Kakutani in a 1979 New York Times profile: “Anybody who talks about California hedonism,” Didion said, leaning to look out an airplane window as they flew from Los Angeles to her hometown of Sacramento, “has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento.”
Didion and Gerwig are both from Sacramento, and so is Lady Bird — the name, she says, is her given name, because “it’s given to me, by me.” She starts her senior year at a Catholic girls’ high school in 2002, with pink-dyed hair, a deep love for Dave Matthews Band’s song “Crash Into Me,” and dreams of getting out of Sacramento to go to college in New York City. On her bedroom wall, she’s scrawled a line from Anna Karenina — “Boredom: The Desire for Desires.” She wants, more than anything, to lead a life that’s the opposite of Sacramento. She wants to be extraordinary.
Drama is conducted jointly with the nearby Catholic boys’ school and led by Father Leviatch (Stephen Henderson). During rehearsals for the fall musical production of Merrily We Roll Along, Lady Bird develops a crush on Danny (Lucas Hedges), the sweet redheaded boy from a big Irish Catholic family who becomes her first real love, though she can’t help eyeing too-cool-for-school Kyle (Timothée Chalamet) at a party too.
The film’s arc is deceptively simple, following Lady Bird through her senior year (which is helped along by some excellent editing and a joyful, buoyant score from Jon Brion). She struggles with math and kisses Danny and fights with Marion. She loses her virginity. She and Julie lie on the floor at school and giggle about sex and eat unconsecrated communion wafers. They go to mass and celebrate holidays. They dream about the future. But there’s a remarkable amount of depth beneath this apparently conventional arc. In Lady Bird, Gerwig has taken the familiar teenage girl coming-of-age plot and turned it into something rather extraordinary and carefully observed, the kind of movie that actually reveals layers on repeated viewing.
Inside Lady Bird are meditations on parenting, on struggling with money, and on the ways the future is never quite what we wanted it to be. But its strongest and subtlest theme is that closely attending to the world around us, and to the people around us, is a kind of grace that makes space for us to love.
 The film is mostly told from Lady Bird’s perspective, and like most high school seniors, her attention is all focused on herself and her own troubles. But through the year, a series of small conversations, captured in vignettes and glimpses, punctures her self-involvement. Everything that happens — heartbreak, embarrassment, disappointment, elation — all of it is evidence that other people struggle too, whether it’s Julie’s sadness at being left out of Lady Bird’s expanding social circle, or Lady Bird’s father’s growing realization that his best efforts to bolster his career are never going to be good enough.
The biggest troubles in Lady Bird’s world are in her family; they’re struggling with finances in a way that a teenager usually can’t fully comprehend, and when Larry loses his job it ratchets up Marion’s anxieties too. Lady Bird’s yearning to leave Sacramento hurts her mother; her shame about her family’s humble house — especially compared to those of some of the affluent kids at school — hurts her father.
The movie’s central pairing is Lady Bird and Marion, in a mother-daughter relationship that’s drawn with rare sensitivity. Marion’s awareness of her family’s money struggles spills over into almost every conversation with her daughter. She refers to Lady Bird’s “wealthy friends” with a kind of bitterness that paves over insecurity, and she’s clearly terrified that Lady Bird will look down on her parents. But Lady Bird doesn’t care all that much about the money beyond how it affects her college plans; she’s worried that her mom simply doesn’t like her very much.
The two of them are in deep need of actually seeing each other, instead of peering through glasses they’ve tinted themselves over 18 years of living in the same house. Lady Bird’s arc moves toward this point — helped along by the inevitable changes that come with high school graduation and the start of college — and when the realization finally hits mother and daughter that they truly love each other, it’s a rare and grace-filled moment to see in a teen-focused comedy. o get all this depth into a film is hard enough; to get it into such a purely enjoyable movie is a small miracle, especially one that’s so loaded with delights. Lady Bird gets a lot about being a teenager right, but it’s especially good on being a teenager during the 2002-’03 school year, right down to the fashions (Lady Bird’s wealthier friends wear the ubiquitous Abercrombie rugby shirts, while Lady Bird’s clothing clearly comes from a thrift store and is a season or two off) and the music — contemporary songs like Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me a River” butt up against the sort of mid-’90s tracks that teenagers of the era grew up listening to, hits by Dave Matthews Band, Alanis Morissette, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.
Lady Bird is about a year younger than Gerwig (and me, incidentally), and though Gerwig’s insisted in interviews that the film isn’t a roman à clef, she renders Lady Bird’s senior year — and the texture of the city where she lives — with such loving detail that it’s obvious how much of it is rooted in a shared reality with her character. Much of that love is directed at the Catholic girls’ school that Lady Bird attends (Gerwig attended one as well), and in particular, headmistress Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), who is a voice of wisdom (and good humor) for the otherwise religiously uninterested Lady Bird.
 But the movie sustains a kind of grace and faith, with the school year’s rhythms fitting into the religious holidays that can’t help but seep into Lady Bird’s bones. And it’s Sister Sarah Joan, ultimately, who opens Lady Bird’s eyes to her real feelings about Sacramento. After reading her college entrance essay, she remarks that Lady Bird clearly loves the city. “You write about Sacramento so affectionately, and with such care,” she tells her. When Lady Bird replies that she just pays attention, Sister Sarah Joan says, “Don’t you think they are the same thing? Love and attention?”
Lady Bird seems only half-convinced, but by the end of the movie it’s clear that the lesson has sunk in. She has, by fits and starts, started to really look at the people around her, and thereby to grow into who she is becoming. Growing up means learning to love the world for what it is — and in making Lady Bird, Gerwig has done the same. Simone Weil would be proud.","Never in my life have I left a movie so disappointed, someone is honestly paying these people ro write good reviews.The plot was tremendously bleak and pretty much non existent, i got no sort of emotional effect? and mind you im a person that is easily moved. The characters were just some hollywoodsy stereotypical tropes of teeenagers, the edgy and extremely angsty white pretty and skinny female protagonist, chubby friend thats always left behind and walked over like a doormat bc of her ""good"" heart, handsome but eventually gay boyfriend, ""deep"" edgy hot hipster second boyfriend and the gorgeous popular girl, the adopted(?) asian brother just for th sake of having a ""diverse"" cast and the overly anxious hard working mom. Wow truly astonishing! Never been done before! The whole movie was extremely cringy, dialogue was painfully unrealistic and nothing close to how real teenagers act or speak but rather a stupid glorification of some sort of silly YA book character from a book probably written by a 35 year old depicting how they WISH their teenagehood was like. A movie bleak like no other. Would recommend to no one , left me with so many unanswered questions."
,,"Credits roll at the end of “Lady Bird,” as they do at the end of every film, but this time they come as a shock.

The cascading names of cast and crew are unwilling acknowledgment that what we’ve been watching is not the most achingly real of real life but an exquisitely constructed, completely entertaining scripted drama.

As warm as it is smart — and it is very smart — “Lady Bird” marks actor/screenwriter Greta Gerwig’s superb debut as a solo director and yet another astonishing performance by star Saoirse Ronan.

Gerwig, whose credits include co-writing and starring in Noah Baumbach’s fine “Frances Ha,” has given us an elegantly empathetic portrait of a teenage girl’s senior year in high school that will resonate even with those (no names) who feel they’ve seen enough teen-centric movies to last multiple lifetimes. In this she’s been helped beyond measure by Ronan, twice Oscar-nominated at age 23, most recently for the marvelous “Brooklyn,” who’s turned herself so completely into a Sacramento teenager circa 2002 it almost seems like witchcraft.

She did not, of course, do this alone. “Lady Bird,” cast by Allison Jones, Heidi Griffiths and Jordan Thaler, has been especially shrewd in all its acting choices.

These include two of the hottest young actors around, Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet as the boys in Lady Bird’s life, a delightful Lois Smith as the head nun in charge of her parochial school and Tracy Letts as her understanding father, Larry. But the most crucial choice of all was Laurie Metcalf as Lady Bird’s mother, Marion.

For though “Lady Bird” deals with the whole panoply of senior year experiences, the heart of things is that particular parent-child dynamic. As Gerwig herself has succinctly said, “the mother-daughter relationship is the love story of the film.”

Best known for her stage and television work (a Tony this year, three Emmys for “Roseanne”) Metcalf’s extraordinary performance underlines the close but combative nature of this fraught connection between people whose intense feelings turn on a dime from pleasure to pain, who can count most of all on always driving each other crazy.

“Lady Bird” begins with an image — mother and daughter facing each other on a bed, more or less mirror images — and a pithy sequence that underline the fractious duality at the heart of things.

Together in a car, Lady Bird and Marion bond and bicker at a dizzying pace. After sharing tears over an audio version of “The Grapes of Wrath,” Marion says “let’s just sit with what we’ve heard,” with Lady Bird coming back with “Are you serious?”

When the talk turns to Lady Bird’s college plans after her senior year at Immaculate Heart in Sacramento (“the Midwest of California”), the divide widens precipitously. Lady Bird insists she wants an East Coast liberal arts school, explaining she “wants to go where culture is.” Her mother thinks that’s unrealistic and bitingly ripostes, “How did I raise such a snob?” Lady Bird’s rejoinder, and it is a memorable one, has to be seen to be believed.

Though she insists Lady Bird is her given name (“I gave it to myself”), Lady Bird, as it turns out, is not even this teenager’s birth name, which is Christine.

But this blithe desire to reinvent herself is par for the course for the willful, oblivious, funny and achingly sincere young woman Ronan animates with a delicious performance that is natural, unaffected and absolutely on target.

While Gerwig, who is herself from Sacramento, has insisted that none of the events in the film literally happened to her, they cut so close to the bone that one can’t help but wonder.

These include chaperones at a school dance insisting on leaving “six inches for the holy spirit,” a college counselor bursting out laughing when Lady Bird mentions Yale, and a football coach who directs theater as if he were diagramming plays.

Also on the scene are the best friend, irrepressible Julie (Beanie Feldstein), classic cool girl Jenna (Odeya Rush), the irritating older brother Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues) and his live-in girlfriend Shelly (Marielle Scott), who tells a disbelieving Lady Bird that “your mother has a big heart.”

And not to forget those boys, classic types each one. Straight-arrow Danny (“Manchester By the Sea’s” Hedges) is the one even a mother could love, while Chalamet, the breakout star of the forthcoming “Call Me By Your Name,” gets self-involved bad boy Kyle just right.

Convinced that “we’re done with the learning portion of high school,” Lady Bird is taken aback to realize, slowly and reluctantly, that life still has lessons to teach that are harder to learn and not easily disregarded. Not exactly pure pleasure for her, but we wouldn’t miss it for the world.","Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project  and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).

Ultra talented Saoirse Ronan plays Christine, aka ""Lady Bird"". She claims it's her given name – a name she gave herself. Entering her senior year of Catholic High School in Sacramento, she's the typical blend of teenage insecurity, bravado and restlessness. Her never quite satisfied mom is played by Laurie Metcalf, in what is probably her career best performance, and definitely worthy of Supporting Oscar consideration. A brilliant opening scene finds mother and daughter sharing a cry, which quickly devolves into one of the endless stream of arguments that make up half of their relationship. Their scenes together are sometimes caustic, always realistic, and likely to hit home to many mothers and daughters watching.

Lady Bird is convinced she must escape 2002 Sacramento and live on the east coast, where she assumes culture thrives. This is the age where every teenager is convinced an amazing destiny awaits them  not stopping to contemplate what talent they possess that might actually contribute to society. Lady Bird is an average student who seems to dream not of greatness, but rather of some vision of life where she will be appreciated for simply being herself. So much of what happens is grounded in the reality of high school life, friendships, and family. She jumps at the chance to be friends with the ""it girl"" who controls the ""in crowd"". Leaving her lifelong best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill's real life sister) in the dust, Lady Bird finagles her way into Jenna's (Odeya Rush) inner circle of rich kids, including the cooler-than-cool Kyle (Timothee Chalamet, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME). He's the bohemian-wannabe type we've all come across. Her attraction to Kyle results in confusion over her relationship with nice guy Danny (Lucas Hedges, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA).

The film touches on many familiar topics, and the script elegantly handles each piece of the puzzle and gives each character their due. Lady Bird's middle class family is going through some financial difficulties after her dad is laid off. Tracy Letts is superb as the dad who is beaten down by a life that's nearly passed him by, but he staves off his own depression just enough to provide the basic strength needed by his wife and spirited teenage daughter. Mr. Letts and Ms. Metcalf aren't TV sitcom parents carefully positioned as punchlines for clever kids, like what we typically see. The emotional bond between parents and offspring is perfectly awkward and deep. Mother and daughter have their shared escapes, while father and daughter share some secrets. There is also a complex sister-brother dynamic, as well as the common issues of school days – teenage girl self-respect, class warfare, teacher crushes, and the pressures of extracurricular activities. Lois Smith has a couple of outstanding scenes as a wise and observant nun who sees Lady Bird for who she is, and provides the necessary guidance. Welcome comedy relief is combined with an editorial statement on the ongoing reductions in funding for the arts, as the football coach (Bob Stephenson) is put in charge of the drama department.

Ms. Gerwig's excellent (quasi-autobiographical) film defies traditional categorization. It's part teenage comedy, coming of age, family drama, and character study – yet it's also so much more. Have you seen much of this before? Absolutely, and it's likely at least some of this has occurred in your own life, though you may not always enjoy being reminded. What is enjoyable is watching the work of a skilled filmmaker and exciting new cinematic story teller."
