Moonlight ,Oscars,"Ultimately, Moonlight is cinema that's vital and profound. If there is any way humanly possible to put this film in front of your eyeballs, you owe it to yourself to do so. This movie is why movies exist.","A masterpiece that makes you feel for the character. The separation into three parts was a great idea, and it conveys its message. It shows Chirons development in a way that makes you feel for him, hard. It shows you the worst moments, and the outcome in the end, wraps it all up perfectly, he truly finds himself"
,,"MOONLIGHT is not a portrait painted in broad brushstrokes, but a tapestry - any one strand can be admired for its own technique and qualities, but standing back to observe the whole is where the power lies.","A young gay boy tries to come to terms with himself against a backdrop of bullying and intolerance. Beautifully shot and well acted throughout, but also incredibly slow and ponderous which won’t be to everyone’s taste. I thought the young kid and the teenage actor both played the character really well, but I was less convinced by the adult version for some reason. The emotions are strong in this film and you really care about the characters. A well made film, but from an entertainment point of view it’s not one I’d want to watch again and again."
,,"Barry Jenkins' screenplay is beautiful in its simplicity, relying just as much on its stars' exceptional abilities to move the story along during moments of silence.","This film is utterly flawless. A24 in my opinion is a breeding-ground for near-perfect films, and this is one of the few that have actually turned out perfect. Everything from the screenplay, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, I was simply taken by all of it. There are few films that can hypnotize me and and keep me in its grasp from beginning to end, and this is one of those films. It is so subtle, and yet so powerful. It's not a movie that lets its actors goes over-the-top with emotion, but rather the opposite, keeping it bottled up and that makes it all-the-more realistic. As I mentioned, each performance given in this movie is impeccable. So many moments gave me chills and moved me to my core. I've never been so invested in a character-study movie before, and I find myself rewatching it over and over again, each time it getting better and better, picking up more slight details along the way. Easily one of the best movies of the 2010's, and of the best character-piece movies of the 21st century thus far, in my opinion"
,,Moonlight has tremendous value both as unflinching dissection of a long-standing problem in the community and for the depiction of a kid with few choices who is unable to rise above the obstacles in his path.,"Overhyped and forced , this film could have used some more dialogue and a louder audio track for that dialogue. Minimalism is a great artistic tool, it just doesn't work with this script. And with the best scene being when Little smashes a chair over the head of one of his bullies, that says alot for a movie that covers so many important topics - where the most entertaining scene can be found on a WWE pay-per view."
,,"The film is largely about the physical and emotional violence that's done to Chiron that enmeshes him in silence, against the grain of the slim moments of inexplicable kindness that break through to nurture him towards trust.","hird act was a bore in my opinion - I'm not a fan of giving such huge emphasis on race and identity in movies (people should be portrayed as who they are as naturally as possible, or else it gives rise to stereotypes and outdated movie tropes) - the deliberate partitioning of the three acts made me want more out of the story. I love coming-of-age films, but leaving out the transitions between adolescence -> teen and teen -> adulthood was a little disappointing to me. And the sections can give us room for imagination, but the pacing made it hard for me to keep my interest in Chiron's development."
,,"Moonlight managed to beautify an area considered horrifically ugly and scarred. The movie also brilliantly tackled black masculinity, crack addiction and bullying with an honest and fresh approach.","Unbelievable. Nicely filmed, but ponderous, slow, not particularly well-acted (although it brought 'sulking' to a new level), I wanted to like the film, but it just went nowhere. While I can understand others enjoying it more than I, THIS is the film that won won Best Film of the Year? Huh? Unbelievable....."
,,"Moonlight is one of those films that play out like a huge build up towards an emotionally taut final act. Some will find the climax too understated but that's exactly what makes it feel real and powerful, just like the rest of the story.","This movie is incredibly beautiful and emotionally honest. A great deal has already been said about its impactful and telling portrayal of masculinity and emotional vulnerability, and how incredibly important this movie is. The actors were all stellar and felt very true to their characters, and the progression of the film was completely satisfying. This film makes you feel something deep within your chest, pain and joy, and underneath it all hope, that is rare and special in art. For any person who grew up as a child vulnerable and isolated, lonely and struggling, this will feel like an honest reflection on pain and hope"
,,"The only way to describe Moonlight is as art. It's pure, unadulterated art. It's storytelling at it's best. It's filmmaking at it's best. It's romantic, emotional, and, most importantly, a film that needs to be seen.","I am probably the only one who actually didn't enjoy watching the movie. Mahershala Ali is the only good thing in this movie. Usually when we are watching a movie we expect a slow start and then much more emotion, a climax after a few minutes. Moonlight takes you through a good start to a boring ending. They killed Ali character after 30 minutes of movie and then you have to watch one hour slow dialogues."
,,"It will forever live as one of the most profoundly touching and mesmerizing films with a fantastic, diverse cast that demonstrated the power of intersectionality.","I admired the filmmaking, but didn't really connect with it. I thought some parts were very slow, especially the scene in the restaurant near the end. I didn't think the third section was as effective as the first two. The child actors are all really good, and I think anyone who has experienced bullying at school can relate to what Chiron goes through. It's not an easy watch and wasn't really for me, but I can see why some people love it."
,,"The film doesn't possess one of those purposefully frustrating indie movie endings where the credits roll the moment the filmmakers ran out of ideas. Moonlight finishes not on a period or an exclamation point, but an ellipsis.","The amount of work and thought that went into each and every frame is insane. This film is extremely meaningful and a beautiful story overall. It is not your typical ""Hood"" movie. The sound design matches the story in a oddly good way, that no movie has ever done before. Only downside of this film is it gets a teeny bit slow toward the end."
,,,"It's a well shot movie that partly feels like it was too obviously written for the critics. If you break the story down to the essential, you'll find too many ""play-it-by-the-book sentimental drama"" clichés and hardly anything surprising or new."
,,,"Taking a look at a coming-of-age story that is as special as it is powerful, Moonlight exquisitely represents two underlooked communities with authenticity and impeccable work from every single person involved. Incredible performances and an outstanding score are two of the things that make this even more emotionally impactful, while it also is visually beautiful, its raw and heartwarming depictions, such as love and types of abuse, are what make this film captivating and shocking, giving audiences a very bittersweet experience that sometimes may not be for the faint of heart, but that it eventually rewards with a heartfelt story."
,,,"The two time jumps in Moonlight are significantly difficult to overcome; especially the latter. Once Barry Jenkins finally gets you hooked on of the three stages of Chiron, he jumps to the next and just like that all traces of the last age flash are completely erased. Now with this said, Moonlight is still a decent movie, mainly because of Chiron's second age flash. I also would've enjoyed Moonlight much more if at least they would've made Chiron's third age flash slightly entertaining. I was bored out of my mind watching Chiron's third age flash and kept waiting for something significant to happen, but at the end of Moonlight I was left with a bland, boring taste"
,,,"This was one of the most beautifully photographed, superbly set, and genuinely authentic films I've ever seen. Jenkins established a time and place perfectly, and told such an achingly honest and unsparing story of identity and self-awakening, it's almost like poetry. The use of a steadicam instead of a handheld gave it an uncommon grace and dignity which added to its authenticity. This is a movie I won't soon forget."
,,,"Beautiful coming of age story about vulnerability and the intersectionality of race, sexuality, economic status and age. Great representation on life. Plus the cinematography was perfect. Only downside was it was a little slow."
,,,"Well done and brave. Great acting. What keeps it from a better rating is that it (even as an Indie) falls into stereotyping. Wouldn’t this be far more moving and real if the kid grew up to be average looking, maybe with weight issues, etc....? But no... the gay black kid has to grow up to be a muscular black stud, and the camera fetishizing him with lingering shots over his torso"
,,,"This is not a very different kind of hood movie. It focuses on the tough upbringing of a boy in the streets of Miami, rather than a lot of street violence and drugs. There isn't actually as much going on as you would expect. And some moments are long. But Moonlight manages to also have some powerful moments, and the cast are all pretty good. It deals with themes such as homosexuality, Afro-American identity and social classes. Which is why it won the Academy Award for beat picture. It's a sometimes touching flick and overall a good and very smart movie. Recommended!!"
,,,"The SAG screener came out for MOONLIGHT. Yet another boring film being hyped for the Oscars. Painfully predictable. EVERY black stereotype and cliche is dragged out before us, one by one. This film tries to do too much, yet covers zero original ground. For those who measure the value of a project in diversity, this lacks it ENTIRELY, being set in Miami, yet does not have a single white or Hispanic cast member. The only white people I recall seeing in the whole film were two background actors eating at a diner. I do not recall a single Hispanic, even as background. IN MIAMI. It tells a threadworn tale we've seen done better before. MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is a wild car chase compared to this (It is also a FAR better film). Pulled in $11MM against a $5MM budget. That's a wash or a loss, folks. Incredibly, rated 98/90. That's rated better by critics than THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. (91/98). The world has gone mad"
,,,"A heavily Oscar crafted indie film that definitely isn't for everybody. But this is what you get with company A24. The performances are spectacular, the directing is sharp, and it knows exactly what it wants to be. If your looking for those elements along with a boring film with thin consistency, no story to tell, weak writing, and characters that are difficult to relate to. Even for the LGBTs, than this is the film for you. For everyone else, it is not really their cup of tea."
,,,"I've seen Moonlight four times and I feel that this is the best film of all time. Never has anything I've ever seen come close to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins is going to achieve legendary status as a director in the near future as he wrings beauty in every scene despite the bleakest of circumstances. The three act structure is beautiful as we see a vulnerable boy who can't be himself struggle to find himself in his bleak life in working class America. It's a film unlike any other and one of the most deserved best picture winners ever. This will and always will be my favourite film and I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every single film Jenkins makes."
,,,"This is one of the more interesting Best Picture winners that I have ever seen, it's a story about underprivileged African-Americans that is not seen through a white lens. There is no black and white in this film, those who treat the main character with love and care are complicit in the abuse of others and that makes a very complex film. Having recently seen If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) it was rewarding to look back at Barry Jenkins' breakout film and see all of the flourishes that make him such a unique director. Thank goodness that this and not the cringe worthy and forgettable La La Land (2016). We see a man Chiron,, at three different stages in his life as he progresses from troubled child with an abusive mother to confused homosexual teenager to emotionally neutered adult. The figures surrounding him who most matter are his drug-addicted mother, Naomie Harris, his childhood mentor, Mahershala Ali, and his high school friend,,. His mentor tries to teach him how to live a moral life but Chiron ends up following in his footsteps and becoming a drug dealer himself whilst his friend gives him a hand job on the beach but later beats him up after facing peer pressure. All of the abuse he has faced in his life lead to him becoming a man who directs all of his energy into exercise and the illegal activities that help him earn a living whilst having no outlet for his sexual frustration. What makes the film special is that these people are seen as just that normal people, not slaves or slightly simple but innocent folks who need to be helped along by an intellectually superior white person. Chiron faces many difficulties in his life a lot of which are probably influenced by racial inequality in the United States but racism is not the focus of the story instead we see his troubled coming of age in a black community in which complex figures exist. Teresa, Janelle Monae, is a kind, motherly figure that Chiron can look up to instead of his own abusive, troubled mother. We see two very different women, both black, with major supporting roles who both have significant flaws whilst also having redemptive moments. This sort of nuance is not present in The Help (2011) or The Blind Side (2009) in which African-Americans are reduced to supporting players who need the help of Emma Stone or Sandra Bullock. The presence of an extremely quiet, self-contained lead character could have made the film difficult to engage with but fortunately all three actors who portrayed the main character were very good at conveying internal strife. In particular,, was able to capture his character's ambivalence about his sexual attraction to his best friend. The actors manage to make their version of the character feel like a natural progression instead of feeling like a completely different interpretation this means that emotional moments have more impact as we have sympathy for that little boy on the beach when we understand that Chiron has become as bad as his mentor. If I had any criticism of the film, I have very little, I would say it's a fairly ugly film and I understand that the location that Chiron lives in is either rough or just dull but I still believe that more effort could be put in to add something to visual style of this film. In Knight of Cups (2015), a very different film I know, Christian Bale or Rick, as his character is known, visits Skid Row one of the roughest neighborhoods in the United States and yet through the lens of Emmanuel Lubezki there is a strange beauty to it. Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers working today and not every film is going to look as beautiful as something directed by Terrence Malick but you would still hope for something approaching grotesque beauty. This was definitely a deserving Best Picture winner as it was much better than any of the other films nominated that year but I personally preferred Manchester by the Sea (2016). Kudos to the Academy for rewarding a non-white savior narrative film about people of color, it's about damn time, but it's rather disappointing to see them regress with Green Book (2018)."
,,,"As a guy who didn't like Boyhood, I feel like Moonlight, another film about a boy growing up, was infinitely better. Boyhood explored every single detail about Mason's life, and many of those details don't translate well as a narrative. Many plot points would be quickly forgotten and were never referenced again. Moonlight only shows three parts of Chiron's life, but those three parts are the most vital to the plot. This creates a narrative that is very engaging. Another thing I didn't like about Boyhood was that it shoved in a bunch of pop-culture references that were really dated by the time the film hit theaters. Moonlight never quite specifies when it takes place, making the film feel more timeless as the years go by. I know a lot of people really loved Boyhood, but I personally think Moonlight was a much better film on just about every level. The characters are more interesting, the story is very interesting, the editing is beyond genius, and overall, I feel that Moonlight will hold up in the years to come."
,,,"Personally I thought Harris was amazing in her role as a mother addicted to crack. Just flawless. Even the first and second Chiron's were great, but of course it is Jenkins who is the master at hand, creating a movie that had this calming quality to it yet is emotionally filled to the brim. That is truly something amazing. Too bad that this then ended on an utterly boring third act which moved so slowly. Did not like that at all."
,,,This movie is the most boring movie i have seen to date. I dont see the meaning behind this pure garbage of a movie. The only reason this movie is scored high is because the main character is a gay black person.
,,,"Nothing special about it. I just saw a french film the summer before this movie and it was basically the same story, the only difference is that there are no moms on drugs and no guy randomly swimming with a small boy on the beach. Everything else is basically in the film. Disappointing that it just felt like an artsy fartsy film that had people saying the N word way too much"
,,,This movie is so boring. The plot was very bad. Only the best part of the film was the first stage of the kid with a great performance by Mahershala Ali. The rest 1 hour and a half was so boring.
,,,"It's over two years since this movie won an academy award for best picture and it's still an easily forgettable film because we have seen it so many times. Don't get me wrong it's a good film as you can see by my score but there are many other films that I remember much better in 2016 and this is the case for many films. The film is a coming of age story for a troubled youth in a violent atmosphere and his journey to be a person of character rather than a person that assimilates the nature of his environment. The most memorable performance without a doubt is Mahershala Ali who plays a father figure with his own ugly tendencies. I don't know if I would recommend Moonlight as it is a good film, but not a great one. It has great drama, but that is expected from a story like this. Still I would suggest that there are many other films to see that you will remember years later."
,,,"If this half ass movie can win best picture than I don't know what will in the future. Anyway the only good thing about this movie other than mahershala Ali's performance was the first act, the score was beautiful and the acting was excellent but it was really boring with a weak story. So in other words it sucked."
,,,"Moonlight is a modern masterpiece. The story may seem simple and familiar, but it is told in an extremely powerful way, addressing themes like masculinity, identity, love, race, class, and parenting, all told in a visceral way that makes the setting come to life through the eyes of the highly relatable outsider. I have no complaints about this film as I still can't get it out of my head. There is and has never been anything like Moonlight."

La La Land,Oscars,"It's the careful balance between the emotional realism of the acting and the sheer technical audacity of the musical numbers that elevates the movie into the realm of greatness even before Chazelle rips out your heart with the extended, bittersweet coda.","Told with an affectionate spin consisting of masterfully vibrant images, La La Land may drag its feet admittedly more than it needs to but quickly corrects most errors with a speechlessly emotional ending."
,,La La Land wants you to take in its beauty and get to know its young dreamers. The ending packs an emotional punch but most of the ride is a joyous visual feast that just wants you to have a good time.,One of the most memorable films of the decade. The casual transitions into mello numbers are a great throwback to an older era. People expecting an all out lungs/dance piece reflecting modern musicals often miss this. The style is supposed to be less committal. Thematically Chazelle's message and vision is also super coherent and he really sticks the melancholy sweet landing.
,,"While the movie is ""tongue in cheek"" and may not completely live up to the movie musical grandeur of olden days, it is, nonetheless, an uplifting, fun film.","La La Land is a movie that affected me deeply from start to finish. Vibrant colors, beautiful songs, excellent acting, fantastic cinematography, and top-notch acting are aplenty in this film. The first time I viewed La La Land it took my breath away, and I don't mean that metaphorically, I literally did not think to breath for at least 10 seconds. I felt that the world had paused, it hit me hard with the brilliant ending sequence. I've since seen La La Land 3 more times and each time it still affects me emotionally, Damien Chazelle has done it again. I had no idea he directed this and Whiplash when I had first seen this, but I was a huge fan of Whiplash as another movie that affected me emotionally. La La Land is a masterpiece and has solidified itself as my favorite movie of all-time. It is beautiful in every capacity, vibrant and boisterous as much as it is melancholy. Thank you Damien for creating this movie."
,,"The director replaces the dances with a sense of rhythm, applying musical mathematics with precision to the cinematographic narrative, its images, the dialogues, carry a hidden musical compass.","STUPID, BORING, WORST MOVIE OF THE DECADE, WORSE THAN CATS."
,,"A shameless love letter to a bygone era of cinema, but it leverages that nostalgia to hide a tragic lesson about life and love.","This film will captivate you from the opening sequence, which I dare say is maybe the best musical introduction since Chicago back in 2002. Gosling and Stone are charming and the cinematography of Sandgren coupled with a flawless direction from Damian Chazelle helped us care for both characters. It will however all be in vain if not for the sublime Justin Hurwitz who created one of the best scores of the decade. Mia and Sebastian theme in particular was so catchy and beautiful, and of course the Oscar winning song ""city of stars"" I'm sure many people will have some other better opinion of jazz music after this due to the simplicity of its melodies. The film will manage to take you slowly but surely to the realistic epilogue that will probably slap you so hard that you will keep on gazing at the screen long after the credits roll."
,,"To love La La Land is to do the work for the film it didn't do itself. It requires sanitizing Sebastian, and to a lesser degree Mia, and endowing them with characteristics they never demonstrate.","I don't get it. People think Ryan Gosling is dreamy, and that's okay. I don't really like musicals, so I'm not the best judge, but I feel like the singers should be able to sing. Don't get the hype on this one."
,,"A ravishing romance, to be sure, filled with romance deliriously exhilarating music and declarations of love in the classic Hollywood vein.","I find almost everything to be overrated these days. This film is just another in a long line of bafflingly overrated movies. The singing is bad, the dancing is bad, the story is bad, and Ryan Gosling's acting sucks (as does his singing and dancing). This is one of those films where all I'll remember about it is that it sucked. I didn't care about the main characters, Mia and Sebastian, at all. I didn't care if they got together romantically or if they succeeded in achieving their dreams. I guess I was supposed to give a crap because they are two young, white, attractive people, but eff that crap. Also, it figures that fake, phony-ass Hollywood would do a movie about some young, white, attractive man doing the black people a favor by championing their music, jazz. This would have been a much better movie if jazzhole Seb had just strangled Mia to death after finding out that she hated jazz. That would have been more in line with his character. And, oh yeah, before I forget, the ""City of Stars"" song featured prominently in this movie absolutely sucks and it isn't even jazz! Just another overrated movie. Just made in America trash."
,,"The takeaway for me is the love story here. At risk of understatement, this is a cinematic love story for the ages. This is a story we haven't seen on screen before, at least certainly not done this well.","Damien Chazelle and company out did themselves with this nod to one of the best eras in cinema. The duo of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were even more electric than they are in real life. With Damien's extensive knowledge of such classics as Singin' in the Rain, Broadway Melody of 1940 and Sweet Charity, La La Land shines with a brilliant mixture of comebacks and new material. With 5 Oscar wins, I feel like the film was short changed and should have won at least 8, including Best Picture. If La La Land is not one of the best movies in history, it certainly is one of the best since the turn of the century."
,,"A gorgeously photographed, unashamedly nostalgic, bittersweet marriage of the modern and the traditional, proving Chazelle's fantastic eye for musical sequences.",Ryan Gosling is not much more than a robot. This is another in a long line of Hollywood movies that are little more than masturbatory reflection into the ins and out of the 
,,"As much it is Chazelle's direction that powers the film, it is the chemistry of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone that ties it all together.","Great concept terribly executed. Flat fake characters with a corny story, could, and should, have been so much better."
,,La La Land shows us a Hollywood fable of failure and desperation dressed up with a fresh coat of new-wave earnestness and nostalgia.,"So a beautiful movie. The cinematography, the colours, the dancing and of corse the music make this such a brilliant movie. The performances from the two leads are great, and you can really feel the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, make notability in dance and singing scenes. Another thing it does very well is not going for the classic Hollywood ending by having the two live happily ever after. Instead the two characters realise that in order to achieve their dreams, they must let the other go. The final scene is definitely sad and the 30 seconds of silence with the characters looking at each other from across the bar is such a great moment as it seems the characters have a full conversation without saying a word to each other. Definite must see!"
,,,"Gloomy. The movie is a daydream peace of art; one or the things that I realy like is the colors of the movie, they fit with the character, there feelings and for sure with the music. Choreography is delicated, and precise with what is happening inside the movie. The score is a master piece, Justin Hurwitz did a great job matching emotions, dreams and music. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were the appropiate for roles of Sebastian and Mia. I can say that if you like musical movies, romance and not looking for a happy ending, you definetly you have to watched."
,,," really wanted to love this film since I have been a serious fan of Hollywood musicals since I was a small child. However, I came away feeling that the sole reason to see this film is to bask in the amazing shots - it is truly a beautiful film. Lighting, staging, color and photography are all top notch, and sometimes transcendent. There is a regularly displayed love of the dolly shot through the film (though in today's tech-wizard film,making, I kept wondering if the oft-used fast-pan was a digital way of cutting between takes, or if it was an actual pan). Disappointingly, everything else gets in the way of the beauty that this film displays. I was surprised that awards were given out for the acting, as it seemed as lacking in depth as the painfully hackneyed plot. I couldn't sympathize with either character as they were both insufferable with no redeeming traits other than their attractiveness (which, to be fair, is commonly the case with struggling LA actors and musicians - but this isn't supposed to be a gritty reality film). I actively wanted their relationship to fail and I usually like silly romantic films (my fave film in the romantic genre is Somewhere in Time). This is a musical, but musicals require BIG songs that you keep humming as you leave the theater and that you want to hear again (think The Music Man, Oliver, West Side Story, Mary Poppins). However, the music in this film was either un-hummable jazz (yes, I do like jazz) or insipid, forgettable songs that I wanted to be over as fast as possible. The vocalists were adequate singers in a bland current-pop sort of way, but that's not how its done in musicals. They're working in a medium that gave us Garland, Minelli, Streisand, Kelly, Preston...these poor La La actors just don't rate. But, oh - those visuals. They are so good that I kept watching to see what was next. So go to school on the photography and if you get into films because the actors are good to look at, you'll be extra happy.Just don't expect substance or the genuine feel of a Hollywood musical."
,,,"I honetly dont know why it was so well recieved. It was the most wooden, mind numbing experience I have suffered under a screen. Can't even remember one song from the movie. Did not carry that musical charm. Only nice thing I can say is that it was visually pleasing, but it was still not enough to hook me in. Movie is all visuals, lack of story, excitement, music, people who can actually sing and pace. Man was it slow."
,,,"Absolutely the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of having to sit through. I fell asleep of boredom the first time, so I gave it another try thinking I might have missed something. I rewatched it and was sorely disappointed."
,,,"I love Musical I have seen most the Disney movie including straight to video and Disney channel movie lion king broadway hair spray grease 1 and 2 westside story sound of music Mamma Mia! tv show steven universe BUT La La Land one of the worst musical I have ever seen, none of the music makes the story move along or progress, they dance for no reason, given it one hour of my life .. regret watching it!!"
,,,"This is the sort of film that makes you detest musicals with how simultaneously twee and self important it is and the fact that the two leads can barely dance and sing. Damien Chazelle directed the very good Whiplash (2014) which explores the pressures of being an artist with dramatic flair but the other two films that he has directed that I have seen have been huge disappointments. This film was frustrating with it's nods to old Hollywood that felt perfunctory instead of feeling like a genuine tribute and it had the sort of half baked qualities that a film like The Artist (2011) possesses. This is not something that anybody should be clamoring to see and it is offensive to the brilliant Moonlight (2016) that this would ever be considered worthy competition to it. Aspiring actress Mia, Emma Stone, tentatively begins a relationship with classical jazz aficionado Sebastian, Ryan Gosling, after they bond at a friend's party. Mia decides to write and perform in a one woman play to jump start her acting career and Sebastian joins a modern jazz band led by Keith, John Legend, who he rebels against as their musical tastes are opposed to his own. Their relationship begins to break down as their ambitions are completely different and their relationship would require a lot of commitment in order to last. They each attain career success but do not end up together and reminisce about the life they could have had when they see each other again years later. From the opening scene of the film in which people in brightly colored clothing jump out of their cars, stuck in a traffic jam, to perform the lackluster song ""Another Day of Sun"" to jerky choreography I knew I hated this film. From this point the film only gets worse as the songs blend together and Stone's monotonous delivery of her lines leaves us rudderless without a charismatic leading lady. I was hoping throughout for some redemptive moment, something that I could pick out and argue in favor of the film for but I was left with nothing. Going into the film I knew that I was particularly tough on musicals, I can only name a few that I actually like, and I detest Stone as an actress but if I can love One from the Heart (1982) and The Favorite (2018) I thought I could tolerate these two elements to find a great film lurking underneath. The success of a musical to me rests on the quality of the song and dance numbers and this film lacks any memorable tunes and the choreography is limited as the two lead actors can't dance. Even An American in Paris (1951), which is mostly Leslie Caron being awful and dull conversation, partially rescues itself with a magnificent final scene but the closest this film got to competence was using a cover of A-ha's ""Take on Me"" over the party scene. Gosling simply can't sing as he drawls all of the lines in his big song, ""City of Stars"", and Stone is unconvincing as a dancer or a singer which ruins the film considering the fact that she is lumped with most of the workload. The scene of the two of them dancing on the ceiling of the Griffith Conservatory could have been something beautiful but it is ruined by the scenes before and after it and only really works when divorced from the dislikable characters. Stone's win for Best Actress is blasphemous as she beat out the far superior Isabelle Huppert in Elle (2016) and will now shamefully be placed in the same category as Jessica Lange and Elizabeth Taylor as an actress undeserving of an Academy Award. Gosling doesn't fare much better although he can give great dramatic performances and Legend's role, essentially a cameo, suits him well. Go watch Gigi (1958) or Kiss Me Kate (1953) if you want an classic MGM musical that actually works but we would all be doing ourselves a favor if this overblown hit was left in the dust. Stone and the poorly written and performed songs tank the film immediately and not one redeemable scene can be found in the film's 128 minute length."
,,,"Hollywood sure loves Hollywood and any movie that celebrates itself. There is no happy ending, no memorably songs, or outstanding performances. I wouldn't say it was bad it is just easily forgotten. Ryan Gosling can't sing and Emma Stone is passable. They really should have found actors that could sing. The movie had no business being nominated for best picture. If you want something to pass the time without making you mad or really bringing out any emotion this is it. Again not a bad movie, just nothing special."
,,,"Gosling and Stone shines and as a result Chazelle marks his name on the wall. La La Land Chazelle is on a strike. With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the ""if's"" and ""but's"" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up. All hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor. I have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out."
,,,"La La Land is gorgeous. If you like film, see it and realize why it had so many Oscar nominations. First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together."
,,,"I don't think I have ever been in love with a movie, like I'm in love with La La Land. From the first few seconds, till the very end. This movie had me and didn't let go. My english vocabulary is not good enough to express my love, heck, my dutch vocabulary is not good enough to express it. This movie is everything. It is beautiful, happy, magical, romantic and I could go on for a little while longer but I won't. I wasn't expecting it to be this musical-y, but I mean, I love musicals so I'm not complaining. I think this is a great ""musical"" because there isn't non stop singing, so people who don't like musicals might like this one because it's more ""subtle"". I can only imagine how much practice went into all those dance routines and don't get me started on the impressive piano skills Ryan Gosling showed us. Something that really impressed me as well was the way they filmed everything. It's a very creative and different way, which I really enjoyed and think makes this movie a great inspiration for those who love film and camerawork themselves. The build up and flashbacks and stuff were really cool as well. Yea I really enjoyed that. Also, the storyline, which does so much for a movie, was so great. This is normally the part were I talk about the actors, but seeing that there were mainly only two actors and they were both amazing (I do think tho, that Ryan Gosling his character wasn't a very challenging one for him because we have seen him in roles like these before. Mixing it up with all the dancing, singing en piano playing though, you got something quite different and I loved it), I'm going to skip this part and say that you should watch this movie, do nothing more, just watch it, enjoyed it and love it"
,,,"This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!"" Where to start? I'll be honest, based on the trailers that I saw I wasn't very excited to see this; I thought that it would just be average or slightly above and incredibly artsy either way. Let me say, I love being proved wrong when it comes to a film being better than I thought it would be, and I was proven very wrong in this case. In my opinion, this is what film making is about. Director Damien Chazelle came out of the gates swinging in 2014 with Whiplash (probably one of my top ten films of all time). He hits the ball out of the park this time by telling the story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a jazz pianist and Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who bump into one another on more than a few occasions resulting in a roller coaster of emotions. I know that musicals (especially modern day ones) are often looked upon in a certain light by most. Sure there is singing and even several incredible dance numbers in La La Land, yet beyond all of that it has so much more to offer. The story isn't the best ever told but the way it is captured both visually and through the song and dance is almost beyond words. Both Gosling and Stone have achieved what I'd consider their best performances in their careers to this point. Please don't go into this expecting Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music or even Grease. This film transcends the traditional role of a musical to offer something that I've not seen before. Damien Chazelle's idea was to ""to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out."" He more than succeeded in his vision by crafting a great movie into a fantastic musical. Too often, musicals have strained performances and misplaced song and dance numbers. La La Land has masterful performances with song and dance seamlessly incorporated to enhance the story even further. Most musicals deliver several great songs; however, this film with John Legend as a producer, delivers incredible songs that have already won awards. ""City of Stars,"" sung by Gosling himself, was a bright point in a film that already had so many. Honestly, before watching this I had no clue that Gosling or Stone could sing. While neither are likely to go on to have exciting musical careers, they both stretched their talents and sung to the level of their characters with perfection. One of the few things that I take for granted in film are the captivating visuals. I've seen so many major blockbuster sci-fi adventures that I rarely stop to appreciate the subtlety that a true artist can bring to the screen. Everything from matte paintings, lighting, and cinematography play a role in giving a film a look and feel that take you to another world. The visuals in La La Land are truly a work of art, the colors jump off the screen, and thanks to the lighting throughout, your eyes are directed exactly where they're meant to be. On top of Damien's incredible directorial style, he also wrote both Whiplash and La La Land. Chazelle is a true artist that I'm looking forward to seeing more and more from in the coming years. When I started these reviews, I wanted to make sure I didn't throw around the five star rating lightly. Even Star Wars (which I happen to be a huge fan of) only got 4 1/2. I've given some older films five stars, but this is going to be my exception to the norm. A film like this doesn't come along often and I want it to be known and be seen."
,,,"The first 2 songs might've not been so well-fully crafted into the story, and I get why people don't like the conclusion. But, La La Land is one of the best musicals in years. It emphasizes more on its strong story than just throwing songs at you randomly. Damien Chazelle's directing was spot on. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry while delivering flawless performances. The music was spectacular. It also manages to serve as a real life portrayal of love, and how sometimes careers and circumstance get in the way of it. This was a great movie guys, don't give it so much hate."
,,,"I love musicals, love broadway, I even have a university degree in Music. Maybe my standards are too high, but I can't get over the amateur dancing and singing in La La Land. I know the actors trained very hard, but I wish this movie's main characters were cast using real broadway talent. Anyway, the movie was so boring that I fastforwarded through it on the airplane. Glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it."
,,,"his turned out to be the worst movie I have seen in years. The characters are weak. It has no be good dance and two decent songs. We ended up skipping scenes as nothing happened in most scenes. Everything was super predictable . The movie has no plot, no tension, weak singing. My family was expecting a feast of dance and songs but it was like a vegan diet of murmured dialogues, some singing. No side characters. Cliched characters and dialogues. I usually donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t do reviews but this one bored me to death. There is a special genre of movies which I call good looking people walking around and expecting you to be entertained just watching them. This one belongs to that genre."
,,,The worst thing about this film is the cooing over it's brilliance. It shows the poor state of popular entertainment when compared to classics of the 1950s and 1960s. You go no where with this ridiculous yarn.
,,,"The Story: Such romantic movie. The story is well written. The story, the music & the dance work so well together. No scene is unnecessary. The Directing: Both of the main casts have beautiful voice and dance so well together. Great chemistry between them. It is always refreshing to see a movie done in musical way. Definitely could feel how beautiful their love for each other. Well done"
,,,"Boy, let me tell you that picture I just watched was god awful, it was goddamn terrible. It was even worse than when I went to watch the lunts with old Sally Hayes though ï¿ 1/2The show wasn't as bad as some I've seen. It was on the crappy side, though(Salinger 139), Sally's an old acquaintance of mine who is not too smart but pretends to be, it makes me goddamn sick sometimes. Anyhow, this movie was way too phony. The guy on the piano was way too serious about himself and made me sick, the thought that the director believed that people actually act like that made me so depressed about society that I just wanted to run away to a cabin somewhere away from everything. But the girl, Emma Stone, she was a knockout and a pretty swell actor to boot. She was the only reason the picture was tolerable, and she was the only good dancer out of all those phonies on screen. She reminded me of old Jane Gallagher, a swell girl that you actually wanted to spend time with. But the rest of those phonies, they made me goddamn sick, none of them could dance and thy were just trying too hard. I guess some of them were ok actors but they were too good if you know what I mean. They just didn seem real and were too phony to be real people. I guess I'd say that this movie was pretty bad but that Emma Stone gal saves it from being awful so I'd give it a 20%."
,,,"While the storyline may not be appreciated by all who watch this film, there is no denying this is one masterpiece of a film. Chazelle's use of colour, sound and light are some of the most creative I've ever seen. The cinematography was used very creatively to work with the other visual components of the film. Both Gosling and Stone give terrific performances and perfectly showcase their skills in both acting and singing. Ultimately, a very enjoyable cinematic experience."
,,,"I know this had a lot of hype, and is critically acclaimed... But I just don’t get why. When I saw this in theaters at the end the audience was talking out loud about how awful it was. The vocals and music (for the most part) weren’t anything special. And the story was confusing. I truly wish I had never paid to see it."
,,,"I first saw this movie a few years back, and I've watched it multiple times during the past years, I am in love with all the songs and this is one of my favorite movies, however, I am giving it 4 stars because while it is a great movie, I usually cannot watch the end because I have ADHD and it's quite boring and there are a few parts that are super confusing and it took me a few times to piece together what was going on. All in all I would completely recomend this movie."

HACKSAW RIDGE,Oscars,"A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making.","Somewhat torn about this. The directing, look and acting is top-notch, no doubt about it. Especially the huge battle scenes are impressive, disgusting and engaging, almost rivaling Saving Private Ryan's. The beginning does take its time introducing our protagonist and his early life. His ultimate engagement is unbelievable and the definition of a hero. While you feel some parts may be a bit exaggerated, the actual quotes the movie ends with prove many details right. On the other side, the film is neither particularly subtle about Doss' belief nor in making monsters out of the enemy. The final taking of Hacksaw Ridge is portrayed rather questionably. Still, Doss' unimaginable heroism is a story worth telling."
,,"Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned war film, melded with a kind of new-fashioned explicitly violent drama.","Good story, though just a tad too Hollywoodized. Realistic fighting and fantastic war effects."
,,"Garfield is excellent as Doss, outstanding in fact, and another reason why Hacksaw Ridge tells such an important story so compellingly.","rom Mel Gibson comes the World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge. Based on a true story the film follows conscientious objector Desmond Doss as he fights to be allowed to serve as an Army Medic and ends up playing a pivotal role in the Battle of Okinawa. Starring Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Teresa Palmer, and Vince Vaughn, the film has an impressive cast that delivers some strong performances. And as usual, Gibson does an incredible job at showing the gritty reality of war. The writing is also especially good; exploring such themes as adhering to one's religious convictions and the personal toll that violence takes. An extraordinarily compelling story about faith and heroism, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful film."
,,Gibson has made a movie that's nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks.,"Charging forth with a pacifist war story that's anything but passive, director Mel Gibson channels the vicious punch and visceral panache of some vaulted war films from H'Wood's past in telling the story of one very Brave Heart who's Passion for the Christ found him sticking to his religious, er, guns during one of World War II's deadliest skirmishes. In this R-rated war movie, pacifist WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) refuses to kill people during the Battle of Okinawa and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot. Sporting a hard R rating, the film unapologetically pains a very bloody picture. Ironically and unsurprisingly skewing more toward the War is Hell mantra (made famous as the memoir title of another unlikely WWII underdog hero, Audie Murphy) than, say, one that proselytizes Peace is Heaven, this film's title says everything about its tone: Hacksaw Ridge. The ironic part arises from the fact that it's a story about pacifist convictions. The unsurprising part stems from the fact that it comes courtesy of a man made iconic by ultra-violent actioner Lethal Weapon, an artist who (kinda, sorta) also made 'historic' filmic violence iconic with Braveheart. To this end, there's two reasons why it wasn't titled The Desmond Doss Story. Due to the extreme but strategic use of violence, he film proves both a thoughtful rumination on the duality of man that's as much a statement by Gibson as Doss. For better and worse, Gibson zeroes in on two flicks for inspiration: Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan (All Quiet on the Western Front doubtlessly is another but many will miss the connection given that, at 87 years old, that film as a cultural touchstone has timed out for anybody but film historians). The better? Hacksaw Ridge comes way closer than most to equaling the gut punch realism of these modern war classics, serving up a demoralizing boot camp segment that would make Jacket's R. Lee Emery's Drill Sgt. proud (Vince Vaughn, in a surprising but rewarding casting choice, believably doles out the vitriol) and setting the second half in an embattled Pacific warzone (amphibious landing, body count, jettisoned limbs, and all) that sometimes looks like Ryan Normandy Beach scenes picked up from the cutting room floor. The worse? The telltale stylistic beats 'borrowed' from these films can't be missed. Still, if Gibson hadn't already earned a place as a vaunted director with Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Hacksaw Ridge almost ensures him entry. The most expensive independent movie of all time (in his heyday, Gibson could get a Mother Theresa snuff film financed with one phone call but, post 2010 public meltdown amid a fickle film industry, he had to piece together financiers like a Shark Tank contestant) delivers a remarkable and well-shot true story. Sticking to your guns - even when sticking to your guns specifically involves sticking to no guns - becomes more than a religious argument. It sets fire to a contentious conversation about a public trying to peacefully go about their day despite mass shootings being an almost weekly occurrence. Destined for Direct-to-Video status after The Amazing Spider-Man series toppled into oblivion, Andrew Garfield gives a layered and nuanced performance. It's not enough that he believably embodies the belief system of Desmond Doss's pacifist, he also looks and acts every bit like the simple - though not simpleton - farmer. As he's proven with Apocalypto and every film he's directed involving armed conflict (and, saved for Man Without a Face, they all do), Gibson puts forth a contemplative message saying peace is better than war but, ultimately, violence as an ends-to-a-means is often unavoidable ...or so it seems. Perhaps, the title of Lethal Weapon was simply hailing the coming of a cinematic realist. To Sum it Up: Soldier of Good Fortune"
,,"The battle scenes in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" are among the most violent captured on film - and also the most urgent.","ne cannot deny that Mel Gibson can direct the hell out of a battle sequence but in this film the sequences would seem to go against the ideology of the subject and there is a horror in having the director openly delight in gruesome violence. Additionally the film is very much of two halves and unfortunately the first feels like a laughable parody version of The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) with how cheesy it is and the second half is entirely discordant with this opening. Many acclaimed the film as Gibson's comeback to mainstream Hollywood productions but I have little appreciation for the film beyond Gibson's technical abilities and I wish that it had a stronger screenplay and was less indulgent in graphic violence. As a child in Virginia in the 1920s Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield, almost kills his brother with a brick and is driven to adopt strict Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and is a conscientious objector when World War II begins. He chooses to enlist despite a romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte, Teresa Palmer, but is confronted by the aggressive Sergeant Howell, Vince Vaughn, when he refuses to learn how to use a weapon. He is almost convicted for his actions but when his superiors learn of new laws he is allowed to become a medic without using a gun. He is seen as a coward by his fellow soldiers but proves his heroism during a battle at Hacksaw Ridge during the Battle of Okinawa. He saves 75 men by helping them to escape down a ridge and men who had previously dismissed him are astonished by his bravery and conduct. He returns to civilian life after the war, marries Schutte and does not become boastful about his achievements by choosing instead to thank god. Before I discuss the second half of the film, where Gibson's interest really lies, I must discuss the first half which felt more like a television soap opera than Since You Went Away (1944) or whatever 1940s classic he was attempting to evoke. Doss is clearly meant to come as naïve but good hearted in his young adulthood but he seems to have some sort of mental issue as he awkwardly pursues the improbably beautiful nurse. The dialogue in their first date scene was atrocious and Schutte's constant smiles and gentle teasing made her seem like the sort of ‘ideal' woman that housewives in the 1950s were pushed to act like. When he kisses her in a supposedly spontaneous moment it was totally manufactured and the moment in which Schutte pushes her religious boyfriend to marry her was so cliché that it could have come out of a parody of this sort of film. The parallels with Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor (2001) were uncomfortable and much like that film you feel as bored as the director does waiting for the macho action to begin. There is an equally awkward sequence before our men enter the battlefield that tries to get us invested in the ‘zany' soldiers that Doss will be fighting alongside. We open with a surprisingly long shot of a man's buttocks and then hear a group of Australian actors introduce themselves in thick ‘Brooklyn' accents. This does little to make us care and there are so many films that these scenes are reminiscent of, from Full Metal Jacket (1987) to From Here to Eternity (1953), that it is hard to view them on their own. Then he introduces the arbitrary drama of having him court martialed and then ends this part of the film on a dull note as his superiors are informed of a fact that they should have already known. When Doss finally finds himself on the battlefield you can sense that Gibson has relaxed as he does choreograph stunning scenes of gore and violence that inform the audience of the horror of fighting in a war. However beyond all of the explosions and close up shots of blood leaking out of men's severed legs there is the uncomfortable feeling that Gibson is enjoying all of this a little too much and unlike his pacifist hero completely endorses violence. The film definitely deserved to be honored for the technical achievements that it made but as a whole it is a disappointment as the points it tries to make about pacifism are buried under Gibson's passion for violence and the dialogue is too hokey to be taken seriously."
,,"The cinematography, editing, and sound pack a surprising amount of suspense, no small feat considering audiences know the outcome.",That was a great movie. The story behind the movie is even more captivating. Andrew did a great job as Desmond Doss. Some of the special effects were very unrealistic but I was so moved by the story itself and the acting it really didnt matter (only mentioned for review sake). Vincent Vohn's initial scene was hilarious....there is no way they didnt do multiple takes. We were laughing so much.
,,"Hacksaw Ridge is an amazingly bizarre film, one that admires Doss' pacifist beliefs while presenting gruesome, festishized violence en masse.","Think of Full Metal Jacket. Now think of a Disney version with boring Christian themes, lame jokes, and forced, predictable dialogue... that’s Hacksaw. The nerdy protagonist acts like he has Asperger’s syndrome. And Vince Vaughn as a drill instructor?? He came off as a flaming gay dominatrix (no offense to flaming gay dominatrixes). I guess Mel Gibson was aiming for another Christian hit, just be honest Mel and change it’s name to The Passion of the Coward."
,,"This is the type of film my conservative family and friends would see, should see, if only it were only rated PG-13. I'm afraid that rating will put off the very people this film was made for... with that R-Rating, it's shot itself in the foot.","One of the greatest if not the greatest war movie of all time. The dynamic shifts from the first half from the second half of the film were like no other. almost 2 completely different films. the acting is top notch, the emotion is gruel. It makes you feel very uneasy and represents the true nature of how horrible war is. However Desmond is this Antithesis of war in the ways he refuses to actually fight. overall amazing movie anyone with any sort of interest in war movies or just great movies in general should give this a go."
,,"Hacksaw Ridge is a movie for anyone who has felt like an outcast. It captures the feeling of having to defend one's values and stand by one's convictions, looking left when everyone is telling you to look right. It's brutal. Tense.","Andrew Garfield was emphatically great in this movie. Terrible first act, a fair amount of pandering, but eventually it hits its stride. Such an amazing true story even the Hollywood tainted focus of Mel Gibson's direction rises up in the end to create a stirring, interesting, and almost non-conventional war film."
,,"After Garfield's Jesus figure spends half the movie telling the higher-ups he's not crazy and that he believes killing is wrong, he announces, ""I never claimed to be sane."" That must be how Mel Gibson gets things done, too.","Overall, the movie was amazing. Has a deep story that is real easy to get into. Whats better is that is based on a real story. The movies takes us on a journey from a madly in love man called Desmond. Desmond comes from a very religious family with an abusive father and a loving mother. Desmond decides he wants to sign up for the army and serve his country. Also, the fact that his dad is a high condecorated soldier also influences his decision, but his beliefs make the journey way harder than he thought. I do recommend this movie if you are into deep, well written but yet simple stories.Of course the movie is a little bit raw and has some bloody and gory scenes here and there, its about war at the end of the day so, watch at your own risk."
,,"On a week where the recent Marvel superhero film is also being released, Hacksaw Ridge is the real superhero film; one about a deeply religious, family man, pacifist that saved numerous lives without ever touching his rifle","Hacksaw Ridge is the true story of Desmond Doss an how you can go to the war without any weapon and win the respect of others with your actions and believes. This movie show us that we have to defend our believes even on rough situations, you can feel empathy with Doss and his decisions during the film. The WWII in this movie is well represented, the battles are so realistic that you can feel you are on the battlefield. The cast made a really good perfomance,Andrew Garfield as Doss is one of his best perfomances on a film also the perfomance of Vince Vaughn deserve a highlight on how you can be really rough with someone that you dont want to be with. You need to watch this movie definetly it bring us how rough a war can be."
,,,the best war film since saving private Ryan. Hacksaw Ridge is a truly gripping and moving film that makes me cry every single time I watch it. Andrew Garfield gives his best acting performance of all time in this film and I don't think any other actor could have done this role justice like he did. the war scenes in this film are truly terrifying and hard to watch it feels and looks so real its genuinely breathtaking. this film may be to violent and hard to watch for some people but its a masterful film that easily deserves more attention than it gets.
,,,"Hacksaw Ridge is a true story about the battle at Hacksaw Ridge, on the island of Okinawa during World War II. This movie shows the realism of war.The acting, writing, and directing is extremely well done. Nothing is ""sugar coated"" and all the scenes feel very real. Many powerful scenes and quotes. The main character Desmond Doss is a man who has a strong faith in God. He wants to be a medic, but will not hold or even touch a weapon because of the 6th commandment. ""Thou shalt not kill"" because of his beliefs he has many struggles. Everyone disrespects Doss because of his beliefs. This is a story of how he became a medic without a weapon and saved 75 men alone."
,,,"Hacksaw Ridge is a similar, yet well made film that documents real life heroism in a very over crowded genre. Its not really a masterpiece, because the war time emotion felt padded on with its extremely basic script. But it tells the story in the right way without having too much of an overlong run time. There is also great directing by Mel Gibson, strong performances from the cast, great visual effects and sounds as it manages to capture the true symbolism of one man's actions during WW2. It ain't no Holy Grail, but you'll be sufficiently enjoyed enough to not even care about it."
,,,"A typical American War Hero movie. The only memorable thing about it, is that it is based on real events, albeit that the events are not realistically depicted. Mel Gibson fails to let the events speak for themselves and makes the film into a bloody spectacle. Chopped of arms, legs, heads,... fill the blood soaked screen for over two hours, accompanied by bombastic violins to underline the heroism of the American soldiers. The Japanese soldiers, on the other hand, are all shown to be beasts and monsters. This is a film that wants to criticize war, but ends up glorifying it. Mel Gibson might have had good intentions with making this film, but he fails to deliver."
,,,"Maybe the most facile WWII yet. Garfield is amazing, acting-wise. Everything else is American Exceptionalist Movie. I guess no Jasp medics existed, just hordes. And by that if this medic loves life so much he should've stayed up on that ridge and deliver it to the Jasps. And the movie also even laughably tried to present him doing such to on Jasp, but just with a bandage to a shoulder. And wow, maybe there were actual medics, German or Jasp, in WWII! Maybe even Viet Cong medics in that war! And well, this movie starts with some kind of Christian hominy, and a lot of that stuff all along, and no sort of Shinto or Confucionist or Buddhist purifying stance for the Jasps. Nah, they're just mostly ants. Very good acting and war scenes though, for that I give it THREE STARS. This review was denied due to my not following community standards apparently by referring to the movie calling folks ""Ja(...)p""s. Maybe if that's a problem this site should ban ""Hacksaw Ridge"" entirely, since that word is in there."
,,,"fun movie to watch action scenes were great to watch acting was top notch, you really feel for the main character the whole way through, you can see yourself in almost anyones shoes in this movie effects were really cool pacing of the movie was good, not too slow and not too fast kinda weird that they added certain things to the movie that werent historically accurate, they could have went with what actually happened and it would have been equally awesome if you hate religious stuff in movies, this is probably still a decent watch, its not forced in a way that would annoy people good movie, would watch again"
,,,"Probably one of if not the best war movie (At least WWII) I have seen since Saving Private Ryan. It has something or everyone, the Religious, Non Religious, Pro War, Anti War, Liberal, Conservative, Veteran, Citizen, Romance lovers, Action Lovers. It has so much good! The Religious overtones are certainly there but not to hit the audience over the head with preachy sermons or ""Bible Thumping"". It's a story about one man's convictions and his unrelenting dedication to them. The pacing is good, the characters all likable, with a surprise role from Vince Vaughn, who I think did a great job as the tough Drill Sergeant. Garfield was fantastic and so adorable in this role. He plays the character perfect and is immediately likable and is someone the audience invests in. And as for the battle sequences, well, I'll let them speak for themselves (They are literally bloody amazing and scary all at the same time)! Also, THIS IS A TRUE STORY. A story I myself have researched and was surprised by how much Gibson had left out of the movie to make it ""more believable"", which is just insane! I am confidently saying, this is my favorite movie from 2016!"
,,,"A terrific war film, maybe the best since Saving Private Ryan. This film is a thorough look at a strong, true historical person with convictions to serve but without bloodshed. The film is masterfully-directed, with an engaging narrative and award-worthy performances throughout. The visuals are also fantastic, with beautiful cinematography! It is a must-watch for lovers of history and war-films, as it is sure to inspire."
,,,"Watery eyes throughout the whole movie. Shows a man with amazingly strong principles and beliefs! This movie is amazing and shows a person who not only defended his principles, but never changed in the slightest, never got influenced by others, saved his beliefs, never doubted God. I have and had certain strong principles, but as the time goes on, you might change them or make them weaker. This happened to me, for example, I didn't really drink alcohol, but when I found a girl I liked, I started to drink some wine, not much though. Maybe the difference is that in my case love, one of the strongest emotions, made me change slightly, so it's hard to resist, while in his case there was no love, but he had his principles and his goals which were very important. Maybe that means he was even stronger than love because he had to leave his girl? In any case, that is absolutely incredible. This guy reminds me a lot of me, except he's even stronger than me. There is a lot of blood and violence in this movie, but I had the time to look away, so I didn't see too much gross things. This movie was very emotional, and I had tears on my eyes and tension throughout the whole movie, not just here and there like it is in some movies. It was very interesting and thanks God for all he does. It is interesting that in war people still save their faith in God and maybe even become stronger, even though you might think that seeing all these torn bodies, torn humans which look like simple organisms might make you think that there's no God, but it seems that's not the case. People's faith becomes even stronger in war. For example like everyone wanted Desmond to pray in the end. Also it seems like a lot of people believe in God one way or another. I recommend this movie to everyone."
,,,"Strengths: I chose to watch this movie because it was nominated for Best Picture a few years back. I see why. The story is Oscar bait, telling a courageous true story. Mel Gibson nailed his work as a director here. He handles the first half of the film solidly, giving us plenty of strong character moments. It's the second half where he truly shines, though. The war sequences are brutal and tense. Body parts fly around, there are abrupt deaths, and you feel like you're right there watching the action in person. It makes sense that this was also nominated for editing and sound mixing. The experience on the battlefield is something truly special. Andrew Garfield (Desmond Doss) gives one of the best performances of his career, other than the bad accent. The rest of the cast like Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss), Sam Worthington (Jack Glover), and the surprisingly strong Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell) all bring their best. Weaknesses: The movie feels long. You completely feel every single minute because some parts do drag in the early stages. Teresa Palmer (Dorothy Schutte) is the one actor who doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. She's not flat out bad, but she lacks something. Her chemistry with Andrew Garfield is almost non-existent, so the love story plot never really works. Overall: This blew me away and was way better than I expected. Other than some pacing issues and the love story, everything works. We have strong characters, a good script, great direction, and the feel like we're truly watching the brutal nature of war."
,,,"This felt like 2 films stitched together. The first half is pretty boring and drags on far too long. We are introduced to the key characters we are meant to care most about, we are shown why the main character is who he is and what his family life did to create the ultimate pacifist during war. The redeeming factor is the second half. Mel Gibson simply creates these amazingly brutal, realistic battle sequences that hold nothing back. The very first death is shocking in its bloodiness and its abruptness, having a survivor of the previous siege become reanimated, giving away the position of the battalion. Once this has happened, we see his head blown off, followed immediately by the death of the man who disturbed him being dealt a similar fate. The following sequence showcases just how brutal war can be, displaying death as being as normal as breathing. This film being based on a true story adds a sense of amazement as you realize not only is this plausible, but it is also what happened. Watching a man, carrying little more then a giant first aid kit, save 75 men who had been injured during 2 days of fighting upon the titular ridge and roping them down the massive expanse at the detriment of his hands. Andrew Garfield, horrible accent aside, plays this role very well, especially as we get more into the war time scenes and the training sequences. This film was nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for film editing and sound mixing, two things that truly mesmerized me during this film. My only complaint is that we did not get a pay off of the brother going to war first nor do we get any insight into the motivations of the father as he helps his son get into the army and also hearing what he has done in Okinawa. This movie is not for the faint of heart, the depictions of war, fighting and death are very realistic and can be offensive or nauseating to those that are not ready for it. Watch at your own discretion."
,,,"Plenty of good rat-a-tat for the war movie fans but you have to sit through a whole hour of schmaltzy love story with dialogue so bad you think the lead character is slightly retarded. The over-the-top portrayal of the heroics gets so bad towards the end that even with the fast forward button pressed the battle is still going on in slow motion. As a whole it's just not worth watching, a shame given the true story behind it."
,,,"honestly,this movie could have been wonderful,it follows the amazing story of an honorable,brave man(also,he is played by andrew garfield,so that's a one up)but it glorifies violence,there was much more then necessary.the movie is amazingly done but way to much blood,also i'm not a real fan of war movies,because all the people that died in this movie,real soldiers died the same way.(including some of my family) it could of been amazing though"
,,,"Over-the-top and excessive in every aspect (some might say indulgent, but others seem to love over-dramatized films like this), from the stereotypic love story to the unrelenting battle scenes. Mel Gibson directed and having not seen any other films by him, I can only suspect that the mix of hard-core religion and ultra-violence is his own personal signature. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who nevertheless signs up for combat duty in WWII (in the Pacific theatre) to serve as a medic. He gets hard done by during boot camp, pilloried for his religious beliefs and nearly court-martialled and drummed out of the service for refusing to carry a weapon. But, of course, he prevails and ends up with the medal of honour. The true story upon which the film is based is undoubtedly moving and inspiring but the syrupy ode to the man is pretty tough to take at times. The centrepiece of the film is more than an hour of gory battle scenes, with corpses everywhere, men dying in horrific fashion, and a genuine hell-on-earth mise-en-scene. Perhaps this is how battle really feels - but do you really need to see it? I'm sure the technical wizardry required is impressive but again, the sweeping music and dramatic crescendos nearly capsize things. A bunch of Australians take roles here (alongside an always charismatic Vince Vaughan) but few are able to define their characters above the fray. Watch if you must but there are better war films (e.g., The Steel Helmet, 1951 or The Big Red One, 1980, both by Sam Fuller)."
,,,"The Jew-hatting director is back and it hurts to admit it's good! Some people just can't separate the oeuvre from the auteur so when the author makes questionably bad decisions in his personal life or if he has a tough personality, his movies will suffer from it. I've heard some people say that they couldn't see a Woody Allen because ""he's a perv"" and some saying the same for Tarantino because he can be too loud (for me, he's the man!). I've never been one of this people but I do believe we have to take into consideration a filmmaker's life to understand his work. Thus, my perception of The 400 Blows wouldn't be the same without me knowing about Truffaut's childhood or Edward Scissorhands would be less impactful had I not known of Burton's inner struggles growing up. I truly believe that Mel Gibson is a despicable person and not that great of an actor... But, he's a talented director! Firstly, the film is based on a great true story that everyone should learn about which is a great structure to the fine script. Garfield is powerful and believable in the character, Hugo Weaving is menacing and, surprisingly, Vince Vaughn is a pertinent casting decision. What may stand out the most about this film is how Gibson constructs a battle scene. He does it without mercy, showing us the true nature of war, all the blood and guts splattering all over, the big explosions and the courage in the soldier's eyes. This, which is supported by thoughtful editing, rugged cinematography and convincing makeup/ SFX work makes up for an immersive experience that is both engrossing and hard to look away from. It's war in it's purest form, like I haven't seen for a while. The problem is precisely when the director's personality surfaces and lets his over-nationalistic pride take over the whole picture. In this day and age, I do think that we shouldn't portray enemies, villains, etc in any kind of movie as generic, as nothing more than evil. This dehumanization of the antagonist is all too problematic in this film, as the Japanese seem to serve the only purpose of being blown up. Furthermore, the stereotypically southern way characters interact, how they create friendships, how they fall in love makes it hard for me to relate to them. Still, the film hit me hard at the end when footage of the real Desmond Doss was shown and I no longer could fight the tears. It's like Gibson was able to pass on to me the ominous patriotic feel and give me a taste of what war actually feels like, which is no easy feat."
,,,"Mel Gibson brings to life the incredible true story of Pfc. Desmond T. Doss in 'Hacksaw Ridge' whose fight to do his part in World War II earned him a Medal of Honor, two Bronze Star Medals, and a Purple Heart as a combat medic. Gripping performances, notably by Andrew Garfield, and some of the most violent and graphic scenes every recorded on film, make this a must-see film about a soldier's contention between faith and valor."
,,,"This is another triumph for Mel Gibson as a director. The story of Desmond Doss, a true hero of WWII is an incredible one and very moving. Andrew Garfield gives a top notch performance and the rest of the cast is very strong. The battlefield scenes are simply incredible, and this film depicts the true horrors of war in a way so many other films just don't."
,,,"cannot believe i missed this in the movie theater. one of the best and awe-inspiring war films i have ever seen.with great PERFORMANCES and great characters, ""hacksaw ridge"" is definitely a must-see that will keep you interested until the very end, and leave you wanting more."

Manchester by the Sea,Oscar,"Manchester by the Sea is one of the best films of the year. It's cathartic, and it reminds us that even in the dark waters of grief, we're never truly alone.","An emotionally devastating movie. Casey Affleck gives one of the finest performances ever put on film. He lives the agonized character in a way that will haunt you for a long time. Brilliant fim, one of the best I've ever seen."
,,"Even if Manchester were not so technically accomplished and beautifully acted, it would still stand as a unique work, simply because you get the ineffable sense that the director has experienced himself what he's depicting on screen","I felt a great variety of emotions when watching this movie. I laughed at times, felt hopeful at times, and cried a few times. The emotionally stunted Casey Affleck plays a tremendous role of a father who can not get over a heinous mistake which caused the death of his children and leading to his divorce. Years later he finds himself in a position to take guardianship over his nephew after his brother passes. Acting by all is incredible, especially the scene where Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck meet and she has her new child with her. The muted tones of the north east USA fits the somber mood of the film extremely well. The choice for it the actors to have heavy Boston accents and carry the ""tough guy"" Boston mentality makes the softening of Casey Affleck even more heartbreaking. This is a fantastic movie of two men figuring out a tough time together."
,,"Its visual modesty conveys the feeling that the director protects his characters, respecting their pain by diverting their eyes and giving them some space","A gently paced, sometimes darkly comic, powerhouse flick where Lonergan's steady hand elevates a fairly mundane, borderline generic idea, into something palpable, strangely energetic and genuinely engrossing. It's not just a performer picture, there's some excellent writing and directing, some neat, easy concepts, and a very likeable use of naturalistic sound. It's a film that can't fully be jusdged until it's complete. It's raw and emotional but not uncinematic. It's a film about not all the pieces of a soul fitting back together. But a few pieces fall into place and that's enough to keep going. It has a contemplative and bittersweet ending."
,,"Lucas Hedges buoys up every scene he's in. And in a compact but explosive role, Michelle Williams brings the whole movie to a standstill with one devastating scene.","Sometimes it feels like some movies exist for the sole purpose of being sad. This movie has one spectacular scene between exes on the street. Its brutalizing. Its probably worth watching the movie just for that scene. Michelle Williams is one of the best actors in the world. Casey Affleck did a great job as well, but I think sometimes fell too much in love with subtlety. Overall, the movie was undoubtedly good, but its just too illusive to be great."
,,"Takes us to a place that few films have ever gone, with a depth and maturity that is a rare commodity in modern cinema.","In my mind's eye, ""Manchester By The Sea"" deserves its praise at the arthouse and filmmaking levels, as it is a poignant examination of human grief that is hard to touch. But perhaps like few other films in history have, it also epitomizes the rancorous gap between the erudite grading scale of Academy Awards voters, and the public's desire to see their most joyously-consumed films be deemed worthy of cinema's highest accolades. It's likely the true fire starter film to the Academy's proposed inclusion of an ""Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film"" award. I personally found Casey Affleck to be very solid but short of mesmerizing as a janitor forced to care for his deceased brother's boy. I enjoyed the film itself far more than the collective acting. But regardless of the nits and gnats, The Academy's recent consideration to recognize blockbusters -- while largely frowned upon by alarmist film snobs -- is perhaps it's the best conciliatory olive branch available, allowing fine films like ""Manchester By The Sea"" to earn its deserved recognition, yet not without an equalizing tip of the cap to public sentiment. This is a very good movie that falls short of an eternal masterpiece, and perhaps might be best remembered long-term by its contribution to a larger public debate between the need to champion great storytelling while also allowing the voices of the masses to also be heard."
,,Manchester by the Sea is pretentious but fantastic performances and a realistic depiction of what grief really looks like elevates this above the normal Oscar bait.,"I've never been the type of person to stubbornly decide whether or not I like a movie prior to giving it a real chance. In fact, I feel I am the opposite—I do everything I can to retain an open mind throughout the entirety of a film in order to ensure I'm taking the entire production in and giving it a real chance. WITH THAT SAID, it took every ounce of willpower I had not to leave the theater in the middle of watching the nothingness that is Manchester by the Sea. Now I'll admit that parts of the movie certainly did provoke emotion, but those THREE thought-provoking minutes didn't make up for the painfully dull remainder of the film. I kid you not, the entire theater walked out at the end with stunned looks of confusion as to what we just watched and why we all sat through the blandest few hours of our lives in order to see if it maybe got better. For the life of me I cannot understand why the ratings are so high for a movie that could double as a sleeping aide."
,,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA may not have the neat resolution you want, but it features tangible characters whose lives you want to be a part of and an unforgettable experience that's rich with all of life's pain and joy",What they don't tell you about depression is that sometimes it feels a lot less like sadness and a lot more like the emotional equivalent of watching paint dry
,,"The cinematography captures the setting exquisitely, the performances are top-notch, and the directing and writing, both courtesy of Kenneth Lonergan, is a marvel to behold.","I was very disappointed with the movie. I had very high expectations and the movie didn't live up to them. The acting was very good especially Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges. I am very big on a movie ending a movie well, and this one did not. It just sort of ended. I sat there thinking wait, that's all. Another Oscar nominated film that disappointed."
,,The masterful screenplay comes to life with such vibrancy that it's difficult to remember that viewers are watching a movie rather than peeking on a Boston family's real lives,"Forced acting, forced accents. Casey Affleck would’ve NEVER been famous without his alcoholic big brother Ben Affleck. Casey’s about as talentless as Channing Tatum, both always plays flat characters."
,,The film really is a work of deft narrative finesse. The use of flashbacks - often a syrupy or lazy trope - is expert from both a tonal and dramaturgical perspective.,"I was very disappointed with the movie. I had very high expectations and the movie didn't live up to them. The acting was very good especially Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges. I am very big on a movie ending a movie well, and this one did not. It just sort of ended. I sat there thinking wait, that's all. Another Oscar nominated film that disappointed."
,,,"Perfect opportunity for an uplifting ending after an incredibly depressing movie. The filmmaker swung and missed. I want a movie to entertain, evoke strong emotions and make me think. This movie didn't entertain, but it succeeded on the other two points: it was depressing as hell and made me thing, ""Why the hell did I waste $12 on this movie?"
,,, masterfully written drama powered by powerhouse performances. Lee Chandler goes down as one of the most tragic in cinematic history and Casey's performance deservedly resulted in an Oscar. The movie's somber and pitiful mood is balanced with an authentic level of emotional humanity rarely achieved. Manchester by the Sea is a career defining masterpiece for writer-director Kenneth Lonergan and will surely go down as one of the most tragic tales in recent memory.
,,,"While it is extremely cotidian almost to a fault, its fully realized characters, along with its captivating atmosphere and soundtrack result in a moving cinematic experience. The actors do a fantastic job of bringing these characters to life and the world is believable, yet raw and bleak. It parallels the life of its protagonist in that it can be a chore to live through and becomes almost unendurable at moments, yet its central tragedy was so gripping as to overcome its otherwise subtle plotting and very slow development. TLDR: Pretty boring but super affecting and very realistic story about life continuing in the wake of immense tragedy"
,,,"This film affected me deeply. It was one of the best and most astute depictions of grief I've seen in a long time, heartwrenching and beautifully told. I loved the non-linear storytelling, and the scene towards the end with Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams was one of the most beautifully realized scenes ever committed to film. Haunting and brilliant."
,,,"This is the sort of film that you have to watch in the right mood, if you don't want to be left broken and in tears or just plain angry. I came to the film as a fan of Kenneth Lonergan, his two previous films are among the best of the 21st century, so I was expecting dark and depressing material and a very flawed main character. The other expectation I had coming into the film was that it would contain great acting and this proved to be true as Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges give beautiful performances. This is a film that deserves to be savored and it is filled with incredibly emotional moments that are painful to watch but have the sort of realism that clings to all of Lonergan's productions. Lee Chandler, Casey Affleck, is a depressed janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts who is called back to his hometown of Manchester by the Sea after the death of his brother Joe, Kyle Chandler. In his will Joe outlines that he wants Lee to become the legal guardian of his son Patrick, Lucas Hedges, and remain in Manchester by the Sea. Patrick and Lee bond as they struggle after the death of a beloved family member and while Patrick juggles multiple girlfriends and Lee's past comes back to haunt him. His inability to change leaves you frustrated with him and yet he is sympathetic in his complete lack of desire to confront his dark past. Lonergan's screenplay, as with all of his screenplays, is very naturalistic in most of it's interactions with this being punctuated by moments of intense violence and emotional conflict where problems aren't necessarily dealt with. When Patrick awkwardly tries to connect with Lee he speaks like a real, immature teenager not like the precocious invention of a middle aged screenwriter. The actors deserve credit for their work in crafting these characters of course but they are given a tight, deliberate script to work with that forces them to act between the lines. The lack of dialogue that Lee receives conveys his utter hopelessness as Randi's monologue shows her own desperation and enduring love for her ex-husband, everything in the screenplay has been so well thought out that it's not surprising it won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. The best part of the film is undoubtedly the performance of Affleck as he exquisitely portrays a broken shell of a man. Although I won't reveal what he is lost we do understand in the film that Lee was once a happy and fulfilled but still significantly troubled man. The way that we see him throughout most of the film however is as a man who refuses to express emotion for fear of the pain of his past fully resurfacing. His reticence hurts those around him as his selfishness and anger is displayed by Affleck's soulless eyes and tightly pulled lips. He never makes his character sympathetic but if he were to even attempt that the film wouldn't work and his unmoved posturing throughout fits the character perfectly. The other standout performances, everyone in this film is great, are those of Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges who each get moments to shine. Hedges get several arguments with Affleck to tear into and he manages to match him as their interplay with one another is spiky but loving, reminiscent of Sammy and Terry in You Can Count On Me (2000). His teenager is self-possessed, arrogant and very naÃ¯ve, in other words he is a normal teenager. Williams is incredible as she inhabits a character who may be even more traumatized than Lee and sells the pain that this woman would have held with her for years so well. I was awed by their abilities and completely believed in their characters and their motivations even when they made strange choices. This is a great exploration of several troubled people with dark pasts who try as they might can't find it in themselves to change. It leaves you as hollow as it's main character but that's the intent of the film, understanding grief should not be a pleasant experience. This is a film that should be watched if you are prepared for an intense emotional experience."
,,,"Forgettable movie for me. As Trump might say, it was just sad, sad and sad. Nothing that could leave any sort of emotional impact on me, not helped by an absolutely long, drawn-out script. Affleck was really believable though in some (very rare) moving scenes."
,,,"I am never going to watch this movie again. boring as hell, none of the characters are memorable, acting was terrible, the fact that they gave best actor to a man that basically mumbles and acts like an asshole throughout the film does not mean he should get best actor. most overrated film people have talked about a man who dose nothing to change himself after basically being the cause of his children death. even the nephew is a total jerk that uses two girls for sexual benefits without them even knowing what he's doing and I'm suppose to feel sorry for him? It was also awkward at most parts of the movie as well with the uncle fighting Wirth the nephew."
,,,"Manchester By The Sea is a movie about 2 irresponsible, selfish people who suffer a tragedy due to being selfish and irresponsible. I mean really, she doesn't want to turn the central heat on because it dries out her sinuses? Nope, just let the kids freeze. And he won't turn back because he has to go buy beer? Sorry, it's really sad and all, but totally avoidable. The rest of the movie depicts the main character's grief and guilt, but does he do anything to grow and change? No, he is just as self absorbed as he was before the tragedy. Just because he stops partying does not mean he grew from the experience. Instead he drinks and beats people up for no reason other than to relieve some of his pain and guilt briefly."
,,,"Despicable characters, a lackluster story, and confusing flashbacks make this a hard watch"
,,,"The best film to come out of 2016. Casey Affleck turns in one of the greatest cinematic performances of all time. Excellent supporting cast as well. Direction, writing and characters are all front and center and you go along with a very dramatic but empathetic showcase. Well done by all!

,,,"Wow. Was expecting a real tear jerker, but instead found myself bored to kingdom come. I know the film has a sad story line and is supposed to be depressing, but no, felt nothing. Yes, its well acted, but the pace of the film is horrific. One more reason to hate the oscars."
,,,"One of the worst movie ever, No story, nothing good, just a spiral of sad events. It was just a waste of time"
,,,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is one of the saddest, most arid films I've seen in years- but it is also one of the best films I've seen this decade. Casey Affleck delivers a phenomenal performance as a permanently damaged man who has to go on living the rest of his life after a shattering tragedy. This is real life realized onto the screen: it will go down as one of the essential American classics."
,,,Overrated. Slow. Kinda boring and predictable.
,,,Absolutly boring! My wife had to wake me up twice from snoring during this movie. It is just a long slow conversation with a changing back ground. The credits were the best part of this lackluster nap time production.
,,,i only gave this movie 1/2 star. after all the great reviews i was highly disappointed. the movie lacked emotion and was confusing with all the back flashes. only made it through 1 1/2 hours. almost stopped after 10 minutes but was curious what everyone thought was so great. still wondering.
,,,"A dreary, plodding, and ultimately pointless film with terrible music, wooden acting, and ham fisted direction. I really do not see what all the fuss is about."
,,,"Casey Affleck plays loner Lee, a man with a short temper and zero social skills. He discovers after the death of his older brother Joe that he has made him sole guardian of his nephew Patrick. Lee returns to the town he grew up in to reluctantly take care of his teenage nephew, a place where he is confronted with memories that led to his separation from his wife and a tragic event from his past that will break the strongest of hearts when revealed. From here he struggles to be the person his brother hoped he would be for his nephew. The film is a painful and tragic portrait of people dealing with grief and loss on many levels. Casey Affleck was superb playing the lead, a man so broken from a tragic past that he refuses to let anyone get close. It's not a film you will want to experience more than once but the film is so well written and acted it is worth hunting down."
,,,"The coups de theatre not withstanding this is a profound piece of tragedy that gently reveals its devastating secrets, creating some unbearable moments, but never losing its dark sense of humour, and Affleck is brilliant in every scene (thanks in no small part to his co-stars)."

I've had more fun watching children's programmes. The ending was the most confusing and ridiculous ending I've ever seen. Don't waste your time with this. I watched this film anticipating an action-packed sci-fi film full of tension and suspense, but was left with sheer boredom and found myself wondering when the good part starts throughout the entire film.

Most characters are empty shells, the movie tries to be atmospheric but ends up just using the same atmosphere in every single scene which kills all the suspense. I liked the message in the end and how it was something I really couldn't have predicted. However it all gets destroyed because almost every character except for the main character and her obligatory unnecessary lover are portraied as unintelligent, impulsive, hostile people. Arrival has a lot of great ideas but it executes them badly. Also I will never forgive them for using ""On the nature of daylight"" as the soundtrack for a mediocre movie, it's such a beautiful piece of music used in such a bad way"
,,,Really boring. Nothing happens. This is why i hate most unknown being sci fi .
,,,This movie was boring and awful and I can't believe it has such a high rating. Wish I could get the time I wasted watching it back
,,, At the end you find out that the aliens are there for literally there for no reason and that you just wasted 2 hours of your life.
,,,If you couldn't figure out how this long boring movie ended in the first scene you weren't paying attention... gawd I wish I hadn't been
,,,one of those you wish you could get your time back from watching...yuck.
,,,I hated this movie. We probably watched it in the summer of 2017. I wrote a note that it was horrible. I remember it simply because I disliked it so much.
,,,"BORING, BORING, BORING! who are these people who are giving this slow, uneventful, boring movie good reviews? You think something is going to happen but nothing happens. Total waste of time. LOUSEY movie."
,,,"while the movie is a spectacularly done science fiction masterpiece, the bizarre concept that our first contact with alien life wouldn't be possible using mathematics is rather uninteresting. This is definitely first contact as told by an english major, and while i understand that math may not be as sexy as languages and that amy adams was the top of her field, I really felt that a better movie might have been the one with Amy Adams being earths greatest mathemetician saving the world. Powerful, gripping, entertaining, and I recommend that if your a fan of science fiction that this movie should be on the top of your list of movies to see at least once. Just make sure to file this under science fantasy when you're done."
,,,"quite literally the worst movie i've ever seen. Couldn't finish it. Just constant long artsy shots, obnoxious sounds, and every character is dumber than a rock. not at all like humanity, basically just a giant trope."
,,,"I hate emotionally driven scifi plots. What a useless thoughtless lazy story. The actress is so timid it's annoying. it's so self involved with it's only plot point of being if you had a kid die would you still have it. the aliens use that overused black particle effects fart thing to communicate. so sick of seeing that in movies. That and the synthy bass drone sounds. slow moving and meandering through emotional violin scores. also plot hole, she wrote a book about the aliens and tributed it to hannah before she met the aliens apparently? such a dumb movie. Make real scifi you money grubbing emotional leech bastards!"
,,,Slowest movie ever. The movie tries way too hard to be cryptic with its feel good utopian preferential message.
,,,"Arrival: Beautifully filmed, solidly acted and completly boring. This overly stuffed scientific flick is not engaging or provacitive, its Science mixed with fiction in the worst way for a cheesy ending thats stuffed and conviluted thats not even worth trying to figure out. Full of weak characters, overly complicated science and no awe- it feels more like a lecture than a film"
,,,"Unbelievably overrated science fiction/time travel movie which seems like the slowest movie in the world and hardly anything interesting happens in the entire movie. The idea is because Amy Adams learns the alien language, she is able to experience time in a non-linear way (not arranged in a straight line). Add to that a subplot of Amy Adams flashbacks of her deceased daughter and the laughable concept that ""Sudan"" the African shithole is mentioned alongside super powers of China and Russia in the supposed retaliation against the perceived Alien threat (the Aliens actually need help to avoid extinction in the future). All in all a very boring movie. Amy Adams/ Jeremy Renner combination works well though."
