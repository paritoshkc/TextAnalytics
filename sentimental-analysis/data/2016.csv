Spotlight,Oscars,Old-style journalism triumphs in the story of the real-life team who knocked on doors and scoured the cuttings library to reveal a scandal that may have begun centuries ago,Spotlight is a movie that I didn't think I would want to watch more than once because of it's subject matter but I can't help myself with Tom McCarthy's masterpiece.
,,"A grown-up film about serious people that mercifully escapes any awards-grabbing platitudes, this is more thrilling than most action movies","9.5/10, well acted and riveting"
,,"This tight, relatively low-key, step-by-step procedural has a stronger impact than any horror movie.","Spotlight was ok, but devoid of any tension, ambiguity, depth, complexity. We all know the story---the reality---that 90 priests molested and/or had inappropriate sexual interactions with teen and preteens, and that the Catholic Church in Boston and elsewhere covered it up."
,,"To turn a spotlight fittingly on “Spotlight,” it’s the year’s best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events.",Thrilling! One of my favorite movie of all time.
,,"It’s not a stretch to suggest that “Spotlight” is the finest newspaper movie of its era, joining “Citizen Kane” and “All the President’s Men” in the pantheon of classics of the genre.",Spotlight takes on the task its subjects brought to life the decade prior with grace pose and a rawness that is gripping and emotionally moving.
,,"It sticks with you, as well-told stories do. As shocking stories do. It's a horrific reminder of the evil that people can do. Any people","Good solid writing, acting, directing, and the film took you into newsrooms and you meet reporters that are becoming too few in this country"
,,It's these survivors who give Spotlight its beating heart,"Absolutely brilliant from start to finish.

"
,,"Bold, audacious and shocking, a consummate piece of work","A story everyone should watch, one of the most important films of the decade."
,,"Put simply, this drama will likely make journalists want to be better at their job and Catholics either quit or commit themselves to making the church do better. It's that thought-provoking.","Taking the #1 spot in the list for my favorite films of the decade, this Best Picture winning film shines a light on the extraordinary investigative journalists who revealed one of the most disturbing true secrets that the church had been hiding for many years."
,,"A polished, engrossing procedural, Spotlight offers plenty of old-fashioned pleasures — chiefly, the sight of smart, scrappy muckraking journalists stopping at nothing to uncover systematic corruption.",Powerful and absolutely perfect storytelling. You won't forget the final 40 minutes of Spotlight.
,,,Great casting though I think that McAdams could've done a better job
,,,"Following in the footsteps of other journalistic drama greats like ""All The President's Men"" and ""The Insider"" before it, this Best Picture winner takes an incredibly engrossing story of investigative passion and layers a thick coating of moral intrigue and subtle, yet effective emotionality on top of it."
,,,good cast and a great story based on real life story in Boston about the Catholic church
,,,A story worth watching! Great!
,,,"What they did with the story was close to brilliant. Although there was not too much happening on screen, they managed to create a dense and believable atmosphere."
,,,"This movie is just mindblowing for me, not just the story but the performance from the casts too, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci played a big part that makes this movie so meaningful for me."
,,,The best newsroom procedural i have ever seen.
,,,An important film...it treads its difficult subject matter with respect and dignity.
,,,Mark Ruffalo shows why he's a mediocre actor at best
,,,One of the best true story-telling movies.
,,,Really well done. Amazing so many people would look the other way.
,,,"As I've watched an ever-increasing number of films across a variety of genres, I've come to the conclusion that the investigative drama is one of my favorite genres"
,,,"This movie was flat, boring, and seemed just clinical and surgical in the way it dealt with such a tragic and controversial topic. I can't believe such a careless and boring snooze-fest won best picture."
,,,An Academy Award winner for Best Picture and an excellent film that gives one a good idea of the code of silence and the vastness of the problem of sexual abuse of children by priests on a scale most of us could never imagine.
,,,"Very good movie, try to detail the facts but in some cases make excessive use of the resource of put crying people in the screen but in general is a spectacular movie."
,,,"Spotlight is one of the most important films of my lifetime. The story is so significant, and Spotlight honors it in a near-perfect way."
,,,"Spotlight avoids all of this portraying it's heroes as able and worthy in their jobs as they face a difficult task but they always feel very grounded and big, teary-eyed speeches about ""integrity"" and ""truth"" are never brought out to sell the idea that journalism is important, we already understand."
,,,The movie is a biography and I love watching films like these because most of the time I didn't even know about the story.
,,,"One of the most rewarding slow burners of the past century. Spotlight heavily utilizes its real life story to perfection, as it addressed the reveal of a shocking secret kept under wrap for years."
,,,"Watched Spotlight. Wonderful film. The acting was incredible and I loved everyones performance, and it didn't unrealistically embellish anything"
,,,
THE BIG SHORT,,"See it, and then dig up a copy of Charles Ferguson's excellent (and Oscar-winning) documentary on the same subject, Inside Job.",One of the most-watched films in my collection. A story that needed telling in a film that delivers the message with wit and a deep vein of anger.
,,Confronting these facts while snorting at how funny this film often can be is quite confounding.,"Hilarious, informative and incredibly well executed in it's descent into the dark reality. The visceral, frantic pace, initially slown down by somehow completely natural cameos and 4th wall breaks is laid down on the viewer in the third act, unexpectedly and yet unavoidably."
,,"McKay hasn't lost his touch as a director of comic performances, and the didactic format lets him shake off a lot of sodden Hollywood convention: the characters aren't required to learn spiritual lessons or even be particularly likeable.","Great performances everywhere you look, a really complicated issue that is dealed with an amazing script."
,,"McKay cowrote The Big Short's screenplay with Charles Randolph, and they know how to keep an audience engaged, broadcasting this knowledge often, as both parody and indictment.",A clever approach to complicated and no so cinematic source material. I actually liked it though and I am glad it was made. It documents a time when real estate just wasn't making any sense.
,,"Lots of pleasant bluster, but spreads itself a little too thin.",Humoristische uitleg van het ontstaan van de kredietcrisis. Mooie set acteurs.
,,"McKay's masterful sendup of late-stage capitalism will leave you saying, ""Never again!""","a must see, one of my fav movies, exelent cast"
,,"Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt lead an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders.","The Big Short is good, but you have to be seriously into the subject matter to enjoy this film as it doesn't do much to appeal to casual viewers."
,,Teems with self-awareness about the complexity of Wall Street while using that opportunity to inject dark humor into what's otherwise a frighteningly bleak reality.,"This movie was fantastic. Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, and Steve Carell did a fantastic job in this movie. When I saw this movie, it made me angry because this took place at the time of the recession in 2008 and I had a great job with good pay and benefits but at the beginning of December that year I lost it all because of the people on Wall Street."
,,You'll leave with both a firm understanding of tranche-bundled CODs and a strange fascination with Carell's wig.,Brilliant. One of the few times I enjoyed a movie as much as the book.
,,"Smart, funny, scary, ingeniously populated and a rollicking good time, The Big Short was such a left-field bolt from the blue and an enormously entertaining few hours in the cinema.",Very well done movie that tells a great story with some awesome laughs. Good performances all around too with the cast
,,,Good film. Sometimes slightly confusing for the uninitiated! Worth watching for sure
,,,"FANTASTIC! Intense acting and unique presentation. With comedy, it engagingly teaches Americans, how we got screwed in the housing crisis. And how the culprits, not only got away scot free but then were rewarded!"
,,,One of the slowest movies I've ever seen.
,,,I liked the ensemble cast and the fast pace. But the screenplay and characters were a little off.
,,,"The movie portrays a unique look into who caused the financial crisis, rather than how it was caused."
,,,What a strange film about a strange time. Well put together
,,,really good story great cast but it was to slow and boring for me didn't keep me interested
,,,"Not my kind of film; most of the financial terminology went straight over my head, detracting from the overall storytelling. I give it credit for trying to approach the subject with creativity and humour though, and so it just scrapes a 3/5."
,,,"A tremendous cast with Gosling, Bale and Carell in particular leading from the front in this financial epic"
,,,"I can't believe how underrated this movie is. The acting is phenomenal and the screenplay is amazing. This is how ""based on a true story"" movies should be. The Big Short is fully self aware and just keeps pushing."
,,,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Working in the banking sector I had a much bigger appreciation for the course of events leading to the conclusion of the movie. It's a must see in my opinion.
,,,"A very well done, engrossing, unique movie. An extremely serious, though dull, topic was taken and broken down in a way that is easy for viewers to understand and keeps the attention of an audience"
,,,This movie finds highly entertaining ways to explain very arcane financial concepts without dumbing things down the way Hollywood normally does.
,,,Most of it went way over my head but continued to intrigue me. Crazy true story.
,,,"Smart, interesting and brilliantly casted...The Big Short checks all the boxes of a masterpiece!"
,,,This may as well be a horror film...
,,,"Smart, interesting and brilliantly casted...The Big Short checks all the boxes of a masterpiece!"
,,,Aug 2019 Didn’t even recognize that was Brad Pitt… Overall learnt quite a bit
,,,Fun and probably informative.
,,,The Big Short (2015) One of the best performances from Steve Carell and Brad Pit. This is a very complicated story to follow but some of my favorite parts of this film is when they are simplifying complicated concepts in simple terms people can understand.
,,,"Awesome, the ""Money Ball"" of the 07 crash. All financial and economic cynics will love it!"
,,,"Good performances, good script and good editing"
,,,Wow movie! Boo capitalism.
,,,"Get ready to go on a course of financial education while cruising through loads of original content of entertainment. It doesn't matter whether you're a financial whiz or otherwise, you'll still have something to take away from this one"
,,,"What an irksome, self satisfied, condescending mess this film is. With an enviable assembly of talent ranging from composer Nicholas Brittel to editor Hank Corwin you would expect a great film that dazzles audience members unfortunately this film is oddly hollow despite the timely subject matter it tackles and will likely leave audiences with a bad taste in their mouths"
,,,"There are so many incredibles and unfair stories about American bureaucracy and McKay looks intentioned to tell all of them, but this movie... this movie may have opened the cinema to news ways of narrative, i found really curious the different direction of this movie which proofs that in movies ultra detailed narrations are possible."
,,,didn't even recognize that was brad pitt... overall learnt a lot
,,,The Big Short is a story that cuts very close to the bone. The rapacious nature of wall street demonstrates that the financial intelligentsia will sell their mother and son to make a quick buck.
,,,"As a mortgage broker since 2004, I basically lived this movie."
,,,"This is a film that focuses on an economic meltdown that people are still suffering from, has to explain the broad strokes of the hard economics that led to the catastrophe, and makes protagonists out of the people who ultimately made millions from the misery of others."
,,,
BRIDGE OF SPIES,,The real power of Bridge of Spies is that it adheres to a sadly old-fashioned code of decency and equal justice for all under the law.,"While you would think the combination of Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and the Coen brothers would lead to something more memorable, Bridge of Spies is still an interesting, engaging, and even emotionally resonant biopic."
,,"Working from an excellent screenplay by Matt Charman that was rewritten by Joel and Ethan Coen, both Hanks and Spielberg are at the top of their game.",Two compelling performances from two accomplished actors in Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead this tense Cold War era drama. Some of the known facts are somewhat distorted for narrative purposes but this is entirely forgivable when the tension is so well delivered.
,,"Spielberg paints everything in broad strokes, and yet for a character-driven spy film to succeed, it's the smaller moments that are the most important-but here they're left behind.",Incredible performances and human touching true story. Absolutely worth to go trough also in order to understand better the political situation of those years. One of the best cold war movies ever made
,,"t's an excellent thriller who knows how to handle a difficult cocktail of drama, tension and humor.","Very satisfying movie with solid performances.

"
,,"An almost invisible camera shows us a Russian spy trapped by the FBI - impeccable sequence, in which Spielberg articulates a certain suspense based on details","Bridge of Spies is one of the best movies of the year. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as well all all of the supporting cast. Performances and script and directing are top-notch. The movie doesn’t offer a lot in terms of surprises but it’s extremely well-made, crafted and intriguing. Nice history lesson as well. One of Steven Spielberg‘s best films in years."
,,"Spielberg's filmmaking shows extraordinary elegance and sweep, a grand visual style that was once called conventional but is now all too rare.",what a amazing film it felt like it was really long but i didn't care because the story was fantastic great performances tom hanks out does himself again what an amazing movie definitely keeps you on your toes at all times big thumbs-up
,,Bridge of Spies is a perfectly good movie from a titan of cinema whose resume is littered with greatness. And there's nothing wrong with that.,"Martin Greenfield Clothiers provided costumes for this movie. They have done business with Donald Trump in the past, including providing his inauguration suit. They have expressed no remorse about this, nor have they vowed to not do any further business with him, so as a person of moral conscience, I must give this movie a 1/2."
,,"As perhaps one of the most quintessentially American filmmakers, Spielberg holds a mirror up to the past and sees us as we are now, a society doomed to repeat our past mistakes if we don't learn from them.",I watched this masterpiece of cinema at my 13th birthday party and henceforth i have watched BRIDGE OF SPIES religiously every night since. It rivals the intense realism of AVENGERS ENDGAME and i cry everytime i watch it. 10/10 definately a classic.
,,Bridge of Spies is absolutely what it appears to be: an interesting story told well by talented people. That is sadly still all too rare among Hollywood studio filmmaking.,"There is a common tendency to greet the films of late career Steven Spielberg with somewhat of a shrug as we expect slick, well made entertainment that also has larger moral points to make as though it is easy to pull all of that together."
,,"It does end in a satisfactory way and over all it isn't a terrible film, just disappointing.",A very entertaining spy drama brought to us by some of the most accomplished film artists of all time.
,,"Spielberg crafts some delightful visual moments, but the editing is often clumsy in stitching together his ever-deliberate camera movements",Three stars it's worth watching.
,,"The film's semi-slow pacing, lack of urgency and generally anti-climactic premise take its toll in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long.",You need to watch this.
,,,"I came. I saw. I survived. 91%? For what? 90% for the name ""Tom Hanks"" and 1% for the rest?"
,,,Bride of Spies is a suspenseful masterpiece from Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. But not the best suspenseful masterpiece of all time.
,,,"Bridge of Spies is a slow burner, but it comes with great payoffs to those who ride it out. The story is not amongst Spielberg's best, but his directing was spot on yet again."
,,,"Spielberg is a good director, Hanks is a great actor and the story is one worth telling. I just found the beginning esp to be a bit boring, altho integral to overall story."
,,,Overall this film is what you expect when you see the poster or read the plot. But credits due as it was quite smooth with little negligible propaganda.
,,,"An honestly thrilling historical drama, with an always impeccable Tom Hanks performance!"
,,,"Badly overlooked film and performance by Tom Hanks. Shrewd direction, witty script. I guess it was too intelligent for the mass audience."
,,,"Avoided this film, just didn't appeal. However, I watched it and really enjoyed it. I guess it was the historic / back in time setting that didn't appeal. A few people said it was good so i gave it a go and was glad i did."
,,,"A solid effort, heavy handed at times, and very serious but always in the right places"
,,,"Bridge of Spies is the rare historical drama that balances drama, humor, and suspense while offering incredible performances from both Hanks and Rylance, along with confident direction in Spielberg and a taut script, making this espionage thriller a bar above the rest in terms of craftsmanship and political tension."
,,,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks re-team for ""Bridge Of Spies,"" a cinematic retelling of the 1962 exchange of captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for crashed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor. "
,,,"After another very good historical film, Lincoln (2012), Spielberg delivers another great and inspiring film on a very important part of global history. The movie actually gets you tense, considering the situation, and Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance give a terrific performance."
,,,"Just as emotionally soupy as Spielberg always is, but very fun to watch. Great actors, great camera work, etc, etc. Well done."
,,,"Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies begins with an image that we only really understand once the movie is over. A tiny, unremarkable man sits alone in his apartment painting his own portrait. To his right is his canvas."
,,,"Well done; I enjoyed it. Not the best film related to the topic I've ever seen, but glad I saw it."
,,,"A solidly made and entertaining Cold War drama. While Spielberg has crafted a well paced film, Tom Hanks is what carries this film. This film may not stand out as one of Spielbergs best but is yet another good film in a huge catalogue of good Spielberg films."
,,,"Hanks and Rylance deliver brilliantly here with two characters you could watch negotiate a new Car Insurance deal let alone, hostage exchange during the cold war. The film and the plot itself I found only so-so, I felt at times it really lacked any dramatic tension. I still enjoyed it though, mainly thanks to the performances."
,,,
Brooklyn,,A low-key tribute to the better angels of American nature.,"The simplicity and relatability in this masterpiece make Brooklyn a fascinating and worth, both telling and watching story."
,,Phenomenal performances from Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen help to elevate 1950s romantic drama Brooklyn in the 2015 adaptation.,A great story beautifully acted
,,"Brooklyn is sublime viewing; beautiful to look at and lovely to watch, with [Saoirse] Ronan presenting her most mature role to date.",i think that the movie was really good because it explores on how an immigrant really feels when they moved to a new country that for them is pretty much unknown.
,,Full disclosure: I did not expect to cry so much during Brooklyn - the journey of one woman learning to navigate her place in the world,"Verdaderamente refrescante, interesante, pero, habia necesidad de doblar el acento tambien!?"
,,"Brooklyn is a beautiful film, in both presentation, with its lush cinematography, and delicate execution.","Anchored by a memorable performance from lead actress Saoirse Ronan, Brooklyn strikes all the right chords for average movie goers."
,,"It is a very sweet, lovely movie that I highly recommend.","Saoirse Ronan continues to build a resume that will go down as one of the greatest of the 21st-century in this lovey, old-fashioned period-piece romance."
,,"Brooklyn actually harks back to the kind of escapist entertainment cinema offered in the 1950s. It's all rather lovely, if completely unchallenging.",Great movie with a interesting plot. Well acted by everyone. It sits with you after it is over.
,,"It's a lovely piece of cinema, and one of the best movies of 2015 to date.",Coming of age stories tend to center around young men played by John Cusack or Richard Dreyfuss who fall in love with impossibly beautiful girls and manage to earn their respect while becoming masculine ideals.
,,There are no real words to describe how moving and emotionally satisfying this story is.,Oscar worthy performance by saiorsa Ronan Definitely must watch
,,a feast for the eyes,"enjoyable cast and story, but, I found it slow moving in many places"
,,"It's this fact that makes Brooklyn so relevant. As our country debates whether to allow refugees in, we need to reflect upon our own histories and recognize so many common dreams and goals.",THESE HOES ARE ACUTALLY LOYAL.
,,,"In a period where everyone tries to bring home the Golden Trophy, Brooklyn manages to be among those very few that try and succeed without winning anything."
,,,Fantastic film carried by Soarise Ronan’s great performance. A rare movie where where they make history interesting and personal.
,,,"Fabulous, fabulous and fabulous. If, like me, you like movies that are character studies and beautiful evocations of a specific place and time...that take the time to develop personality and tensions between the characters, this is a fim you will treasure."
,,,Really touching romantic coming of age story.
,,,"It is kinda boring and uninteresting, but the cast gives some top notch performances that are worthy to watch."
,,,"I think it was a wonderful movie. Heartwarming and educational. But sadly enough, I haven't seen much talking about Tony. In my eyes, he seems like a manipulative person who has pushed Eilis into lots of stuff; from saying 'I love you' to marrying him, even though she told him not to push her."
,,,A nice and calming living room drama!
,,,"Normally, this isn't my kind of movie. I came away pleasantly surprised. The characters are mostly likable and the acting is incredibly charming."
,,,"The movie is amaizing, have a special story, really cool actors and perfect landscapes. the movie required many diferent locations to take pictures, and to be recorded. the director was directed by John Crowley and stared by( one of my favorites actres) Saoirse Ronan."
,,,"I just spend almost two hours watching this movie, but it felt like only 15 minutes. It's entertaining till the end and I feel like I want to know and learn even more about Eilis Lacey and her life in Brooklyn."
,,,Excellent period piece with great actors!
,,,An endearing tale of immigration and romance. Brooklyn (2015) is a sweet coming of age romance surrounded by the homesick feeling of leaving Ireland for America.
,,,I saw this on Christmas of 2015. Great film. It made me think a lot because of how frustrated I was with Saoirse Ronan's character throughout most of the film.
,,,Loved it! Beautiful storyline which gives an expressive insight into both our inner and external feelings when grappling with life-changing decisions and heartache.
,,,Sentimental and relatable story about a woman trying to find her way and build a life in between two countries. Great chemistry between actors.
,,,"Tears of solidarity in Brooklyn - Full disclosure: I did not expect to cry so much during Brooklyn. Maybe I should have known better. After all, it's a sweeping, coming of age story about a young woman who leaves her family, and everything she's ever known to travel thousands of miles to seek new adventures in Brooklyn."
,,,
The Martian,,The Martian is the movie we need right now.,The best part of the movie is that it starts out on Mars. It doesn't fully-dally around on earth to start the movie like Interstellar did(which I also love).
,,"The Martian is a major return to form for Scott, who seems inspired by NASA's can-do spirit.",One of the best movies that I ever wachted.
,,"Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic.",A textbook hard sci-fi movie
,,"The Martian consumes audiences from start to finish. Damon's witty performance makes the film both fun and intense while Scott's balance of Mars, Earth, emotion, politics, science and humor is an impressive and enthralling feat.","Honestly, this is one of my favorite movies. It feels so realistic. This is one of Matt Damond's best performances. It's not often a movie with an actor carrying that big of a lead ends up being a success but this is certainly an exception."
,,"The Martian"" is this decade's ""Cast Away,"" but if ""Cast Away"" took place in a world that was constantly plugged in and online.",This movie is actually a good adaptation of the book except with less science explained
,,"The Martian is that rare film that both thrills and inspires, so much so that i'm sure it will be seen repeatedly at the theater and at home for years to come.",A masterpiece from a Marth movie.
,,I can't see fans of the book (myself included) being remotely disappointed and imagine newcomers will be equally as enamoured,i did rly enjoy this movie. sometimes a little bit too much waiting. but its rly rly good
,,Scott manages to take potentially dry scientific ideas and turns it into thrilling cinematic gold,Amazing Film that takes place on Mars where we follow the abandoned astronaut (played by Matt Damon) fighting for his survival. The story is brilliant and futuristic theme is throughout but is fitting and not clunky or out of place.
,,The Martian is a stunning return to form for Ridley Scott and a great film in its own right.,This movie gave its audience a lot of credit for being intelligent. Sometimes the audience was too busy eating sour-patch kids to notice. I wish I'd read the book first.
,,Definitely my favorite live action film of the year.,A fun and thrilling movie that perfectly shows the ideal engineering mindset.
,,,The scientific accuracy together with a thrilling storyline is what makes this movie a masterpiece.
,,,"Doesn't miss a single big-movie beat and of course with its array of good-looking actors, state of the art CGI and top-notch lighting and set design, has quite a look to it, and radiates, for once, a positive view of human exploration and endeavour which marks it apart from absolutely every other big film being made these days."
,,,"Yes this film does have a great sense of humor, but unlike the weird placement as a comedy at the Academy Awards, the Martian is not a comedy."
,,,Just might be the best movie of this Decade.
,,,"Where Interstellar may have intellectually overshot audiences, The Martian strikes the perfect balance by reeling it in while Matt Damon provides the human link to the moviegoer who's just out to have a good time, and still giving the hardcore sci-fi types what they want."
,,,The Martian is a very entertaining and suspenseful movie.
,,,"Great movie. A space epic. I wish it had won so many more awards, because it deserves them. If you have not watched this movie do yourself a favor and watch it, you will not be disappointed."
,,,great movie that keeps you interested and makes you laugh
,,,"One of the best space movies ever made. Exciting, funny and so smart. The Martian brings us a plausible space experience, strongly featured by maybe the best acting of Matt Damon."
,,,Great movie. Matt Damon solid as always.
,,,"I watch this film at least 3 times a year, it's all the right space in all the right places."
,,,"This movie makes me both sad and angry as a big, big fan of the book. It strips out a lot of the humor, cuts out big parts of important story and struggles for the character of Mark Watney while making it seem like he survived just by accident."
,,,One of those movies about space that makes you love being in mother earth.
,,,Probably see the trend of the movies I like. Yup another space movie I enjoy
,,,"Good, and Matt Damon gives a really good performance. Space movies aren't really my thing."
,,,One of the best space related movies.
,,,"The Martian was a difficult movie to rate and that's because it's so damn entertaining! Matt Damon is again wasting NASA's money because he needs to be rescued, but he is so likable as Mark Watney that it doesn't matter."
,,,One of the best modern space movies. One of the best things about it is the respect for realism. The book is better but this film is a fantastic adaptation.
,,,Personal think movie was overrated. While some really cool scifi scenes the movie goes its slow pace in space and creates superficial tension often playing everything as joke that don't really stick.
