The Wolf of Wall Street,Oscar,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy: fast, funny, and remarkably filthy.","Great movie, funny and entertaining"
,,"Here is a white-collar crime caper that stirs golden memories of the Scorsese back catalogue, often quite knowingly and sometimes to a fault.",Another overrated movie.
,,"A big, unruly bacchanal of a movie that huffs and puffs and nearly blows its own house down, but holds together by sheer virtue of its furious filmmaking energy and a Leonardo DiCaprio star turn so electric it could wake the dead.",It's just decent movie with slight above average story. Basically it's for people who are into finance and stuffs.
,,"A brazen three-hour cinematic bender of sex and drugs set to the tune of financial chaos, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is undoubtedly the craziest movie of Martin Scorsese's career.",Great movie every second was with purpose
,,"A terrific and fascinating movie, but it stops short of masterpiece territory.",Why make that book into a movie? It's not entertaining. It's not funny. It's not fun. Yuck.
,,"The Wolf of Wall Street plays modern tragedy as epic farce, reminding us just how much fun Scorsese can be when he's in a playful mood.","Well acted, directed, and fiendishly engaging. (B+)"
,,"Working with a gutsy script by The Sopranos' Terence Winter, Scorsese is jabbing hard at America's jackpot culture. The laughs are merciless and nonstop, every one with a sting in its tail.",People blame this movie for reality it portrayed. It was a clever way to tell a story.
,,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a slippery beast, both beguiling and repellent on the surface, more difficult to pin down the deeper you look, and shifty in ways that I found intoxicating.","Great movie!! It definitely does not feel like three hours long and while it isn't Scorsese's best work, it's still a must watch, and the sex and drugs is not as shocking as others make it out to be, and Leo's performance is incredible and is one of the funniest performances I have seen in a long time!"
,,"Whether he's on the phone luring someone to send him a check for a dicey investment, or flopping around the floor after ingesting too many quaaludes, DiCaprio hits the jackpot.","The biggest issue with this film is its length. I can't tell if it's my attention span or whether story telling should go on for this long. I'm not sure why Scorsese doesn't feel the need to edit. The film has plenty of entertaining moments, but if it were condensed, the film would be ten times more tolerable. I love stories with dark themes as much as the next guy but to say this film doesn't promote every bad thing in the bible would be a textbook example of denial. The tagline should be ""If you become a criminal, fraud, alcoholic, drug and sex addict, don't worry you can just become a motivational speaker when it's all said and done."""
,,"Wild, offbeat and insane, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is one of the year's best films and a definite career-topper for DiCaprio who, with Scorsese, have given us another phenomenal collaboration","One of the worst films I've ever seen. Entirely irritating from start to finish. Horrible characters, over the top, annoying acting, no redemption/gratification plot wise, absolutely no reason to watch this film....looks fairly slick but so what?"
,,,Underrated classic and one of the most rewatchable films of all time. 10/10 performance from Leo ofcourse. This film cemented his legend
,,,"Tried to finish it, but couldn't stand how STUPID it got, to the point of being a waste of time. Obviously over-hyped high rating. Grade: D"
,,,"The movie focuses less on the art of persuasion and more on the sex and drugs escapades of the main characters. While at times funny and well acted to an extent, it loses focus and drags on with their crazy ""rock star"" like lifestyles."
,,,Very entertaining movie. Not one of my favorite Leo performances. I thought Jonah Hill was great. It really drags a lot in the middle of the film. I think the film is a tad too long but it's still good.
,,,The story line was hard to follow unless you set though the entirely of the movie. The only good thing about this was the rating they gave and the end. That's three hours of my life I'll never get back. It was distasteful to the human eye.
,,,"I normally love everything Leo does, but this movie just left me so mentally exhausted."
,,,"The Wolf of Wall Street may be an entertaining film based on a true story, but it places too much emphasis on style over substance and fails to become anything more than a compilation of short memoirs from Jordan Belfort's life."
,,,"I can appreciate aspects of this film, of course, but certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
,,,"It was shocking but I loved the story, the dark humour and the acting...:) Especially Leo DiCaprio was a killer! :)"
,,,"a tale of how quick you can go from nothing to something..back to nothing. Leo plays the part and sells the life in a fun film thats easy to imagine if ya smooth on the phone. s/o Dustin Kearns , great actor used to receive a blow job while in an elevator during the good times at work during Leo's winning days on the Wall Street."
,,,his movie is fun filled but maybe a little bit to fun at some points. But really the story itself is just mind blowing.
,,,"Insane, dynamic and well acted. It shows the best and the worst of the wall street experience without it ever getting boring."
,,,Not for all tastes but definately a lot of fun for those who won't be too offended.
,,,"It's a hell of a fun ride, but that's about it. If you're expecting some rich character study or life lesson you won't find it here. That being said, I don't see this move as condoning the acts of Belfort either. It's merely a surface level look in to a world most of us won't ever get a better look at."
,,,"One of my favorite movies, every performance in fantastic, the writing and direction is amazing, and it's real fun."
,,,"Very well directed and acted. Interesting to see this mostly true story of an 80s/90s dishonest brokerage company. He roomed with Tommy Chong in prison, lol."
,,,"A brilliant movie with amazing acting, great script and awesome cast!"
,,,Entertaining but definitely overrated
,,,"Wow- what a wild roller-coaster of a movie! Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese have made great movie magic together once again with a stellar cast to tell a very entertaining version of Jordan Belfort's story. Jordan Belfort was a stock broker who put together a band of misfits who violated many securities laws to become rich, high and decadent. Highly recommended!"
,,,"A little too focused on outlandishness and vulgarity, I still found the Wolf of Wall Street quite enjoyable, thanks to the brilliant performances, some humorous moments, and a generally captivating story"

12 Years a Slave,Oscars,"A strong, involving, at times overstated telling of an extraordinary life story.","There are so many movies that has had a huge impact on our world as we know it, and unfortunately, not so many people watch these movies. This, however, is a movie that I believe should be shown in history classes in school's because, this really is a movie that everybody should watch. Steve McQueen once again shows us his beautiful range in this beautiful movie that surely is a so-called masterpiece."
,,"Stark, visceral and unrelenting, 12 Years a Slave is not just a great film but a necessary one.",(95/100) 12 Years a Slave is a masterpiece. Steve McQueen is able to bring a heart wrenching story about the brutality of slavery while being able to give the characters a real personality. Overall just a beautiful movie about something horrific.
,,12 Years a Slave is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery.,"Great! Definitely deserved the acclaim. Brought slavery to a very real place for many people. So many scenes have stuck in my mind since I first saw it. Great acting, powerful film."
,,"In the epic form of 12 Years a Slave, his most approachable, emotional film, McQueen escalates the tension.","12 Years a Slave is brutal, compelling and amazing. Brilliant performances (notably from Nyong'o) with brilliant editing ultimately deliver a very, very good movie."
,,The harrowing 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing period drama for the ages,"I don't get why the high rating of this movie. I absolutely hated it!!! And I want to know why in hell Lupita Nyong'o, got awards for this movie. Did she even have a full paragraph of dialogue? She cried every time she was on screen. The who movie sucked. I honestly thing someone payed someone at the Academy Awards, to win so many, when none were deserved."
,,"A harrowing, unforgettable drama that doesn't look away from the reality of slavery and, in so doing, helps us all fully, truly confront it.","There are so many movies that has had a huge impact on our world as we know it, and unfortunately, not so many people watch these movies. This, however, is a movie that I believe should be shown in history classes in school's because, this really is a movie that everybody should watch. Steve McQueen once again shows us his beautiful range in this beautiful movie that surely is a so-called masterpiece."
,,"12 Years a Slave, British director Steve McQueen's antebellum Southern drama, sets a new standard in realistically depicting American slavery.",This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel like people rate it highly because of the subject matter. I'm no movie critic but I was excited to see this film and left the theater extremely disappointed.
,,"12 Years a Slave is likely the most painful, clear-eyed feature ever made about American slavery. In that light, it almost seems faint praise to add that it will also likely prove to be the best film of the year.","So much more than the ""white guilt"" label it's unfairly gotten. Steve McQueen continues to prove himself as one of the best working directors today. It's his most mainstream movie to date but this proves to me that he really know what he's doing and is careful in his selection of what to make. Everything about this movie is exceptional."
,,12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from.,Was it good? Yes. Under normal circumstances id give it a 3/5 but it won an oscar it didnt deserve. I went in expecting an amazing movie but was disapointed
,,One of the finest historical movies ever made.,Did NOT live up to the hype. Bland cast with unlikeable characters. Do not bother.
,,,"I was expecting more from this movie. While it was a very sad film, it was very slow-moving at times."
,,,"Well shot and emotionally resonant, albeit quite overrated (still better than the even more overrated Django Unchained). People seem to fear thinking freely when a movie deals with such a historically--and contemporarily--unpleasant subject."
,,,"12 Years A Slave is an intense movie. It's worth a watch, and I'm sorry I didn't see it in theaters. Compared to todays films, 12 Years is worthy of the accolades it received."
,,,Brilliant and worth watching. It's the best movie of 2013.
,,,"The end may feel underwhelming upon first viewing, despite staying true to the source material. However, it's unflinching realism, stunning attention to detail and perfect pacing make it a seminal, and illuminating film about one of the darkest subjects of American history. Everybody must see this movie at least once."
,,,"An exquisite piece of work. Sensational performances by birth main and supporting characters. A couple of unnecessary scenes, but overall a remarkable masterpiece."
,,,A good account of the past but just missing something.
,,,"A film that originally appeared to me as another political tear fest of seeing how black slaves were oppressed and feeling bad about being white (don't get me wrong, I have nothing against black people but sick of the politics behind it all) actually has a deeper meaning here when you see the brutal torment of our main character, Solomon Northup, in particular that pulls the movie through as something to emulate as deserving of it's nomination and later victory in Academy Awards. The film takes place in what is assumed to be the Antebellum South where Negro salves pick cotton and perform other grueling outdoor tasks for their white masters. Our main character is thrown into the mix while trying to prove he is free and getting no sympathy in return, being whipped and worked to death, told not to escape lest his life be not spared, and even being forced to whip a young Negro girl much to his heartbreak and dismay. The emotions are crystal clear and the film totally engulfs itself in the experience of slaves at the time. If you are weak at heart, or any other weak constitutions, I suggest you skip this one. This is the uncensored abuse in full bloom, constant whippings, hot sun, grueling work, bitter cruelty, the whole nine yards. You feel the pain watching this movie, and I think that's the heart of this film. Which like I said works to it's advantage, but I do wish they focused more on the narrative. The first hour or so focuses on merely the experience of the slaves. They work, they sing (very nice singing), they have families, they feel weary and hopeless yet committed. And while that's intriguing, I got more invested in every scene that showed Solomon's struggle. He wasn't supposed to be one of ""them"", an aspect to this brutal story that would have made this film stellar to me if it was brought out more. He gets his redemption at the end, he has conversations about it, but everything else is drawn out around him that it's fighting for room. Another nitpick I have is the titles on screen that tell of the setting of the movie and what became of Mr. Northup after he was finally freed. The font was incredibly small, and illegible without a magnifying glass. Maybe it's just me, but that was really distracting. Fundamentally, this is a good movie, even if it's not your favorite movie of the past year. It's emotionally resonant and tones down it's agenda enough to grab a broader scope than perhaps originally intended."
,,,"12 Years A Slave is essential viewing. Brutal, realistic and perfectly performed by Ejiofor and N'yongo, the film isn't exactly fun or entirely entertaining but it is powerful and real and feels extremely respectful to history. Rating: 83"
,,,What an awesome movie. Makes you realise how lucky we are.
,,,"Amazing. A phenomenal tale of hope, tragedy, love, and inhumanity. The most compelling and gruesome depiction of American chattel slavery I've seen, bound inextricably with the most heartbreaking display of strength and courage. A must see."
,,,10/10 Great film. Disturbing but powerful.
,,,"12 Years A Slave is not bad, but I think it's a little overrated, let me explain why. The main character isn't that interesting, the movie don't takes its time to make us care for the character. Some scenes are fast paced and that's a waste, because you could have really put some emotion. Some scenes are even too slow paced, it's not a bad thing to have slow paced scenes, but to pace these scenes slowly was useless and didn't really make sense. The score was done by Hans Zimmer and it distracted because it sounded so much like the Inception score, I can't be the only one who didn't notice. With all these things said I don't think this film is a bad film, there are some interesting characters, there are some good atmospheric and effective scenes and I think the acting is great. I liked it for what it was, but while watching I thought this Best Picture winner could be much better."
,,,"A MUST WATCH....a classic indeed!!!based on a real story the movie takes us to the colonial period during which black peaple were majorly kept as slaves and physically and mentally harassed and when coloured peaple were treated as a white men's property...the movie is based on a free man, named solomon,who was black and hence kidnapped and sold to white men just because he was black and no one could believe it that a black man like him was actually not a slave by birth but a well civilised eduacated free man.first he resists and rebels but then accepts it gradually that to live and fight a way out he has to live and not just keep on fighting and die and hence accepts the life of a slave stone heartedly for the next 12 years untill some hope comes...a powerfull naration with some awesome screenplay by everyone...though not for the weak hearts but still a must see for all of us to remind us what mistakes did mankind did and to never let such dark times come back again in anyone's life around us... spine chilling but ends on a happy teary note"
,,,"Phenomenal, in every way possible. Lupita Nyong'o's performance stands out the most, delivering an incredible performance which I (an aspiring actor) fully aspire to be as good as"
,,,Quality movie that grips you from the get go. 8/10
,,,Undeniably an important film. Sad and powerful.
,,,This was an amazing movie. The end was emotional and I even cried a bit.
,,,"Well acted, well shot, well directed, heartbreaking narrative, there's nothing about this movie that you'll exactly like, but it's a story that needs telling, and the storytellers did their job extremely well."
,,,Most depressing movie ever.

American Hustle,Oscars,"Intelligent and good-looking, American Hustle could've lost 20 minutes to deliver an even sharper kick. But otherwise, fun for those who like vibrant humour - that's extremely grey.","There are some genuinely funny and well written parts and all the actors are delivering the goods, yet I couldn't help but feel this could have been shorter, more on point. It requires quite some concentration during some parts to follow the details of the caper and the entire who is fooling who. Overall enjoyable, especially the use of music, but slightly overrated compared to Russell's other works."
,,"American Hustle offers so many easy pleasures that people may not think of it as a work of art, but it is. In the world that Russell has created, if you don't come to play you're not fully alive.","Another big winner from one of cinema's finest current writer/directors in David O. Russell's mostly-true account of ABSCAM in which federal agents coerced a couple con artists into exposing corruption and backroom dealing that involved high-ranking politicians. Christian Bale is fantastic and nearly unrecognizable as the con man, while it's wonderful to see Silver Linings Playbook co-stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence reunited onscreen even if their scenes together are brief. Like that movie, this one also unfolds with the tasty precision of a well-crafted novel, and the plot twists in the final third are brilliantly conceived and wholly surprising."
,,"American Hustle is an extremely entertaining ride through the human condition, with characters just short of ridiculous. The beautiful thing is that Russell does this without becoming mean.","A total mess. David O. Russell's direction plays like a ringmaster who's lost all control of his circus animals. Amy Adams and, to a somewhat lesser degree, Christian Bale do their best to keep the tent from completely collapsing."
,,Ridiculously entertaining in all the best ways.,"A masterpiece. Movies as good as this one happen once a year. Incredible performances from all actors, incredible story. It's not a comedy but the comedic parts always land. It keeps you on the seat until the end."
,,"It's one of the year's cleverest films, and also one of the best",Smart and devilishly fun! American Hustle's cast shines through a slick script and a stylish vibe!
,,"Ambitious even as it studies, exploits and explodes ambition, ""American Hustle"" is as good as any American film this year. It's also a lot of fun. Don't miss it.",Nothing but marketing hype here.
,,"American Hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the American Dream, reinvention. If you're not happy with who you are, or who people think you are, then go ahead and become somebody else. Anything to survive - and thrive.",Smartly written and wickedly funny.
,,"An extremely entertaining, brilliantly acted, highly diverting film which — like all hustles — delivers less than it promises. Still, it’s worth being taken for the ride.","There are some genuinely funny and well written parts and all the actors are delivering the goods, yet I couldn't help but feel this could have been shorter, more on point. It requires quite some concentration during some parts to follow the details of the caper and the entire who is fooling who. Overall enjoyable, especially the use of music, but slightly overrated compared to Russell's other works."
,,"American Hustle is about life as a performance, the ways in which we perceive ourselves and wish to be perceived by others.","""American Hustle"" is an amazing drama film of 2013. ""American Hustle"" has superb acting from ""Christian Bale"" and ""Jennifer Lawrence"". ""Jeremy Renner"" is a great actor, but in this film he didn't seem to be too believable for the most of this film. The plot to ""American Hustle"" is that a con artist named ""Irving Rosenfeld"" who gets caught by the FBI, after he gets caught he must work with the FBI to bring down the mafia to get a reduced sentence. The plot to the film is exciting and the ending is amazing. The dialogue in this film is great, there aren't too many annoying characters, some of the dialogue is funny. The music in ""American Hustle"" fits in with the scenes perfectly, the music is great for the drama in this film. I liked the way the movie was filmed. The camera man did a great job filming this movie. If you enjoy dramas' then I highly recommend you watch this film as it has superb acting, an amazing plot and great dialogue. I give ""American Hustle"" an 8.5/10."
,,"AMERICAN HUSTLE is light, but succeeds in entertaining with its plotting back-and-forths and slightly ridiculous characters.","Wonderful setting and inspired acting, but the climax resolved a little too quickly for me."
,,,"Great cast, great performances, compelling story. This movie is right up my alley."
,,,"Over rated, but decent movie. Kept waiting for something to really draw me in, but that never happened."
,,,"A near perfect crime mirrors an immaculate mix of surprise, nostalgia, and tension in which the loaded cast is able to effortlessly dominate"
,,,"American Hustle was good. great cast, great director and of course GREAT FILM :)!"
,,,The movie was one of the best. The actors in it played perfectly and where hilarious. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. I recommend it to everyone!
,,,"A good classic movie. I adore all the actors and thought the casting was great. I do like the premise and it is different. I see how it was nominated. Not over the top amazing, but great"
,,,Amazingly tight script and directing with an excellent cast lead to an electrifying movie that deserves all the praise.
,,,"""Some of this actually happened"" set the stage up for me to give it a go. And it wasn't half as disappointing as I'd feared. Some of the parts felt overdone, but it's fine otherwise."
,,,This movie was just okay! I liked the concept though!
,,,"Amazing cast, performances, and a great story. It reminded me a bit of GoodFellas. Excellent overall themes and kept me guessing until. Definitely worth watching."
,,,"Great film, great plot, great styling and great acting. The only negative is that it is a little long and drawn out."
,,,I found this a little slow going but it's a solid story with some great acting and well worth watching
,,,Couldn't even get all the way through it. Stupidest movie ever.
,,,"Charming, witty and full with the atmosphere of 19th , certainly blew my mind away start from the beginning until the end. I'd recommend this movie for those who like to think ALOT."
,,,"The best movie made in 2013, flawless in all aspects, and one of my all-time favorites."
,,,"Hustle is an incredibly smart, funny, and old school crime film that keeps the audience guessing. It heavily benefits from its witty script delivered flawlessly from its impeccable cast."
,,,"An oddly uninteresting film. Characters in 70s costumes pulling off a historically-significant FBI sting should be more interesting. ""American Hustle"" has a strong premise: two con artists (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) are forced by the FBI (led by Bradley Cooper) to participate in a sting operation to nab corrupt politicians. I'm sold. But the execution is off. By injecting some eccentric comedic pieces into the plot, it lowers the stakes ""Hustle"" has set up for itself. By the time a menacing cameo from Robert De Niro shows up, you don't know if the film wants you to be amused or wants you to be tense. Either way because it is never clear what kind of film ""Hustle"" wants to be you find your mind wandering as the game actors keep showing up in over-the-top 70s garb and hair and throw out their lines with gusto. It feels like a costume party with some amusing attendees but you find yourself in the corner nursing a drink waiting for something to happen. Disappointing but ultimately saved by the acting and the 70s visuals."
,,,It was good nothing great
,,,Totally Awesome movie from Start to finish. Awesome Soundtrack
,,,This movie is ridiculously well-written. The compelling characters completely draw you in. Their lives are like that car crash you slow down to stare at on the freeway. You can't look away.

Captain Phillips,Oscars,"Arguably Greengrass' best film, and almost certainly his most urgent","Captain Philips is very thrilling, well written and Tom Hanks's performance is extremely powerful! Paul Greengrass captures the realism and the overall film and performances are very convincing."
,,"""Captain Phillips"" will grab and hold your attention from its first few minutes to its startling conclusion.","Powerful and intense with excellent acting from all especially Tom Hanks, perhaps the best he's ever been."
,,"It's not meant to be smooth sailing, and overall ""Captain Phillips"" is a voyage well-worth taking.","A remarkable performance from Tom Hanks in his middle age since we missed him from his movies from the 90's, too bad the academy didn't appreciate him enough to make the list for Best Actor.. Meanwhile, Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse got a delightful attention from the critics with 1 BAFTA Awards and an Oscar nomination.. The story itself is quite interesting, but how Paul Greengrass made the movie is another thumbs up since he make not only a great drama but also a thrilling movie that will keep the audiences hold their breath like they been on Phillip's experience.. Overall, 'Captain Phillips' definitely one of the best movies in 2013"
,,"Basically, this is a crime story that slowly builds to a very good second half, and a drama with a fine performance at its heart. And that's how it should really be seen.",Great adaptation of a true story. Captures the feeling of being on the boat. Captivating and exciting.
,,"The film succeeds on its own terms-an exciting entertainment that makes us feel good about the outcome, and about the reach of American power, rather than its limits.",5/5. The first half is Die Hard on a boat. The second half is Zero Dark Thirty on a boat. Combine them together and you have an extremely effective thriller with fantastic acting.
,,"A ruthless, ripped-from-the-headlines seafaring thriller with a vintage turn from Tom Hanks.",An edge of the seat thriller! Recommended.
,,"This tense drama in the high-seas will leave you feeling claustrophobic. The film is an archetypal Paul Greengrass thriller, which keeps you on the edge of your seat","Captain Philips is very thrilling, well written and Tom Hanks's performance is extremely powerful! Paul Greengrass captures the realism and the overall film and performances are very convincing."
,,One of the year's best films.,Absolutely fantastic!!! Great acting by Tom Hanks. Non stop action and drama.
,,"We watch these films and wonder about ourselves, about who we are, why we are here, what we would do.",Very intense on the edge of your seat flick. Of course Tom Hanks is amazing.
,,A survival saga that raises the pulse and tweaks the conscience.,An unsuspected great thriller that is filled to the brim with tension and great acting. Hanks at the top of his game and not uncounted the brilliant supporting work also. I was holding my hands so hard under these two hours and it was very well made. Hand helled camera was very affecting.
,,,"This movie is amazing. A perfect way to tell the true story. The acting, especially from Tom Hanks, is incredible, the directing is great, and the ending is heart pounding. One of 2013's best."
,,,"Great modern true story that gives the audience an appreciation for Captain Phillips. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the performances by every single person in this film are incredible, what amazes me is that this was Abdi's first movie role as well as the other pirates and their energy and expressions give you chills. Hanks is spectacular and the score adds to the intensity and urgency. A great film."
,,,"Not a bad film, Tom Hanks is great but if you only see one film about a hijacking watch A Hijacking instead"
,,,Really good. I kept it together along with Hanks until the last scene. Now that's acting.
,,,It started off a little slow but once it got going you were hooked. Even if you already knew the outcome going into it the story completely captivates you.
,,,"A thrilling movie with themes of heroism, humanity and survival. Fantastic performances all around -- but I gotta say, I love Tom Hanks. Brilliant."
,,,Really enjoyed this movie and although lengthy I really enjoyed it. It's edge of your seat stuff and a true story too!
,,,This is an intense and excellently executed film. Tom Hanks puts on an amazing award winning performance. One feels immersed in the movie; it's gripping and you can almost feel as if you are there.
,,,This was a great movie! Great acting by all. It kept me guessing with what was going to happen next (especially since I hadn't been following the real story when it happened). We rented this at home... Perfect rental.
,,,Great all-around movie and Tom Hanks knocks it out of the park as always. Captain Phillips is a must see if you like high intensity true stories
,,,"""Captain Phillips"" definitely got me on the edge of my seat. It's gritty and emotionally gripping, but the slower parts are quite unmemorable. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Adbi are great in tandem, feeding off each other's energy."
,,,An incredible film which will keep you on the edge of your seat. Awesome film a bit emoitional and fantastico.Also pointing out how the world is run by psycho's
,,,"Excellent performance by Mr. Hanks and the rest of the cast. Kept my attention and engaged my interest. A fair amount of action and suspense. Overall, very good."
,,,"A hyper-realistic collision course that leaves the viewer rife with emotional distress on how important it is to have armed security on a cargo ship in an area where ruthless, dim-witted Somali pirates are present. Expect a climactic lifeboat standoff that will leave you breathless and appalled at Tom Hanks' unforgettable freakout performance."
,,,Yes! The basics of the story is true but the creators took some liberties adding some fiction for entertainment value. Still enjoyed the film.
,,,"Excellent all around movie! Great acting and screenplay! Action and suspense! I could watch it over and over again! Very interesting how they hi-jack the boat, and then how the real game of cat & mouse begins! Definitely worth the watch, highly entertaining! A+ Rating!!"
,,,"Believable, straight-ahead, plausible dramatization of the real-life piracy story it's based on; sheer entertainment, but not mindless, with good dynamics between the two ""captains."" Exciting, enjoyable movie - won't blow you away, but remarkably competent, and the ending is more human and realistic than most comparable (action) movies you've seen."
,,,"An intense showcase of great actors. You cant stop feeling the feeling that tells you that this really happened to somebody, that somebody went through this. Great movie, see it."
,,,"It's surprising that such a big ship company doesn't care enough for security, all the more when it's route involves piracy zone. Besides, it was funny to see Hanks igniting and shooting the flairs in the direction of the skiff, only to miss every shot. And why didn't he care to shoot one right when they were below the boat preparing to climb through ladder. Anyways, it was entertaining. Just that I was expecting an action thriller biopic, but instead got to view a comedy-of-errors sort of movie. Tom Hanks performs eerily and the character Muse is a bit funny. The hide and seek in the boat also adds to the entertainment"
,,,"Superb film that is sympathetic to all sides, that has very good performances, doesn't always go where you think it will and is brilliantly paced leading to a tense finale. Captain Philips is a common old garden, run of the mill captain of a container ship. He has an everyday hum drum existence except that he is assigned jobs that occasionally require him to venture into lawless waters. When he gets such an assignment he is extremely wary and cautious of this so when his ship is boarded by pirates (who are African type and not of the peg leg, eye patch and parrot variety) this has not happened because of any complacency on the Captains part. The crew do their best to delay the capture of the ship and things do not go to plan for any of the parties involved. Add to the mix the eventual involvement of the authorities and the politics involved with this completely changing the playing field and not always to the captains personal advantage. My favourite part of this film is the last 20-30 minutes. It is expertly done and is up there with director Greengrass's efforts in the Bourne trilogy. What he got right in those films he does again in this. The performances are good and I especially liked Hanks role later on as his situation became more and more desperate. To think that the cast of the pirates had no acting experience to speak of makes their convincing performances all the more impressive."

Gravity,Oscars,the plot is simple but the cosmic space is beautiful. This movie must be a challenge to shoot a realistic drama of human activities without gravity.,"Simplistic, fast phase, emotional roller coaster that delivers pure deep space terror; nerve wracking suspense; outstanding cinematography, and awe inspiring performance by Bullock and Cloony. Certainly, reiterating that in space, as breath-taking its peaceful beauty could be, can harm anyone in the most cruel manner. Anything could happen in the infinite abyss and no one could ever lend a hand. It's like watching 'Final Destination' in a space setting that possesses more engaging characters, surrealness and delivers a good story with a subtle message."
,,A brilliantly tense and involving account of two stricken astronauts; a howl in the wilderness that sucks the breath from your lungs.,"Boring! Beautiful, but if it's not on a big screen, don't bother. So there is no rewatch-ability."
,,"If the film past is dead, Gravity shows us the glory of cinema's future. It thrills on so many levels. And because Cuar‪ón is a movie visionary of the highest order, you truly can't beat the view.","Vastly overrated. Special effects were amazing, and that’s about it. The plot is boring, the characters are boring, the dialogue is boring, the title is even boring! I nodded off several times during this snoozefest of a movie."
,,"This isn't just the best-looking film of the year, it's one of the most awe-inspiring achievements in the history of special-effects cinema.","This film is a masterpiece. The performances of the actors, especially Sandra Bullock, are great, visual and auditive is great, the story is exciting. In conclusion, it is among the best films about space."
,,Gravity is a crowd-pleasing version of what scientists and mathematicians are said to experience in their rarefied sphere-a wondrous fusion of faith and science,"Definitely one of the worse movies ever made. They just made a script to show off the all new special effects. Boring characters, all non relatable, and u don't feel for them. Even as they try hard with one characters backstory or in other words a previous event she reveals. Complete garbage. Will never watch again, and I bet those who rated this movie good won't watch it again 2."
,,"""Gravity"" presents an artificial world that could only have made been today, and provides a fantastic showcase of new possibilities.","A technical triumph. Visually stunning and superbly directed, Gravity is a thriller of nightmarish scenarios that are believable, not only thanks to the very high quality of acting, but also the fact that they are based on actual physics"
,,"If our exploration of space emerged from imagination, science and the spark of inspiration, the extraordinary ""Gravity"" uses those same tools to craft a movie that might correctly be called a thrill ride with a brain.","Simplistic, fast phase, emotional roller coaster that delivers pure deep space terror; nerve wracking suspense; outstanding cinematography, and awe inspiring performance by Bullock and Cloony. Certainly, reiterating that in space, as breath-taking its peaceful beauty could be, can harm anyone in the most cruel manner. Anything could happen in the infinite abyss and no one could ever lend a hand. It's like watching 'Final Destination' in a space setting that possesses more engaging characters, surrealness and delivers a good story with a subtle message."
,,"Nearly everything about ""Gravity"" feels right, from its appropriate but compact running time to its satisfying conclusion.","Very overrated. The plot feels rushed, we're thrown in to space before being thrown about it, there is no character development at all, so I felt like I couldn't care less if they all died up there within the first 30 seconds and then a new plot continued down on earth. The visuals were very good, and the concept of the film is very novel. I will never understand the hype this generated, or why people are still pretending that it deserves the rating it has even now."
,,That rarest of breeds: the intellectual blockbuster.,"Gravity is a taut, somewhat haunting thriller that makes you feel like you're in the cosmos"
,,An existential action movie that unashamedly embraces the sensation of awe.,"Visually amazing and led by a stunning performance by Sandra Bullock, Alfonso Cuaron's passion project is both ambitious in it's effects as well as it's ideas - and raises the bar for future 3D oriented movies."
,,,"Gravity is an effects extravaganza with near miss after near miss. The action is almost continual, of the ""out of the frying pan, into the fire"" variety. If the trailer piques your interest, you are unlikely to be disappointed. Sandra Bullock's performance is solid. Gravity's main drawback is lack of pacing and lack of dramatic tension. There are no flashbacks and many sequences are long shot after long shot to the point where it goes from impressive to showing off. Still, I'd have to say Gravity is what it is supposed to be: action-packed and thrilling."
,,,"I felt as though it started halfway through. There was plenty of suspense, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting."
,,,"Really intense and stressful throughout the movie. Sandra Bullock did amazing. She's basically the only character and she did great. The visuals are really stunning. The music and sound mixing was really good also. I did not like how George Clooney had to let go, the science doesn't make sense to me. Unless I'm wrong, there should have been no force pushing him out. I was entertained throughout the movie."
,,,More physical than intellectual; it's a movie that makes you feel one thing: fear.
,,,"It's not the best film of the year in my opinion. The special effects are great and there were some intense moments. But there were parts in the film were it began to annoy me and some parts felt forced. Overall with masterful directing, intense moments and one breathless movie, just lacks a good main cahatacter"
,,,"Great film, Produced very well. It grabs you from beginning to end. Very intense and at the end you have to sit back and take a breath."
,,,A great story that totally pulled me in. Not once did I think about the artiface used to tell this tale. It is visually stunning and a great tale.
,,,"A really intense thrill ride that doesn't let up and keeps you interested all the way without letting it get boring or letting the characters drag. One or two pointless moments, but other than that, a damn fine film."
,,,Great movie! Didn't think it could be as good as it was with only two people acting in it! The only thing that bothered me was some of the physics in the movie got messed up but it's such a great movie I can handle it to watch it again!
,,,"The story is far too cliche and the characters are very poorly developed in this film. While some of the special effects were spectacular, much of the science is inaccurate and the events are far too unlikely to have occurred."
,,,"A captivity movie that although very similar to other survivor film plots, keeps you interested and invested the entire film. Bullocks performance entices any audience member who has even felt any loss or even the possibility of loss. Excellent timing makes the movie seem almost too quick but never leaves a hole in the plot. The trauma that Mission Specialist Ryan's feels for her daughter is well conveyed and connected."
,,,This movie makes the most ordinary thing on earth super extraordinary. Who would have thought that standing still on the surface of the earth could be so magnificent.
,,,Convincing space film. Thrilling and deeply engaging emotionally and I could feel myself breathing and reminded of how wonderful it is to be on earth as Sandra Bullock landed after the huge ordeal. Very powerful film.
,,,Very good special effects and acting in this space thriller. You literally gasp for air at times.
,,,"So overrated. There are multiple plot inaccuracies in this, like the place where Bullock's character lands on Earth at the end of the movie. I mean, how impossible is it that she manages to land in a deep enough body of water that just happens to be so close to the shore? If she lands on land, dead. If she lands in the middle of any ocean, dead. But the movie can't end like that, right? It does have great visuals though, and the SFX are truly impressive. But that can't hold up a movie by itself. I had really high expectations too, that probably made me dislike it even more. I just don't get why this is being called a classic and being compared to 2001. It's really not that great. 4/10"
,,,"The hype is overrated. One of the poorest jobs I've ever seen reviewing a movie on this site. Little to no story, mainly just heavy breathing and floating. 97% is stretching it. Maybe 80%. The blindness critics suffer must be horrendous, because this movie was utterly boring. Perfect evidence that in our generation, its how it looks, not feels or sounds. The fact that it has seeped to our elders is saddening. The movie was so polished by CGI that it blinded everybody to the fact that the movie is written barely passable, if even. Disappointing to see this movies Tomatometer at 97%, whilst true masterpieces like Prisoners sit at 80%, and are completely ignored."
,,,"Moved by a top-notch script full of beautiful messages, stunning performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, breathtaking visual effects and an outstanding score by Steven Price, ""Gravity"" not only can be labeled as the best film of 2013, but also as one of the best space-themed films ever made and as one of the best films of all time as well."
,,,Brilliant film! I was on the edge of my seat throughout.
,,,"Good, but lacks a punch."
,,,the plot is simple but the cosmic space is beautiful. This movie must be a challenge to shoot a realistic drama of human activities without gravity.
